You know what I do is to write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can take it like farmer, or <unk> or leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated cycle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle began in the middle of the middle school in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleeding every week in the bathroom and the kids -- until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when I could get into the bathroom <unk>
He was doing it in secret.
For three years, for three.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California, and I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations who struggle against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that adults have never got to know us.
Could you be able to help you -- and please bring that man to know that you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to relate to you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And so we went to see, and we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found it a place, the <unk> and the monitored and we had her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about became present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved the <unk>
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of your life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly -- I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> to me around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think that it was a <unk> about another <unk> than a year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from glaciers or break down the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has his own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to retreat and hold up to the end, whereas others can't afford to be more and <unk> in a <unk> of passionate <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated <unk> and by themselves, as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts, I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As a eardrum the iceberg gets richer, freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are such a way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last few photos I'd like to show you is from one iceberg I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of frequent to actually be able to witness a <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> out of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So two couples with a baby.
I don't want you to stand up too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome -- and the sperm joins the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome joins the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity on the ground on two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way that people will define anatomy -- and that is, of human bodies.
The other role that performance is in my job is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, it would be <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with a much lower people who are much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics doesn't fit into the <unk> male and conventional feminine <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't be <unk> in the traditional standard forms or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that they become <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't have to bury testosterone, your body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So there's high testosterone levels and <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops on a course is typically female.
When I <unk> the baby is like a little girl.
It's a little girl, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast death, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And after doing tests they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has a <unk> and an Y.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's really not like this.
Women, as men, like men, we have the body called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women as I -- I consider a Catholic woman -- don't know his bionic structure, I think it will be a typical woman, most of the women as me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who have <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a little bit complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old and 19 year-old boy born and raised like <unk> he had girlfriend, and sex with her, he was wearing a life as a kid, and he had just figured out he had <unk> and <unk>
I had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th sensors and the uterus were <unk> the areolar glands, were so active that essentially creates a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, your genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was 19 years old, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors found that, in fact, she was a woman in the inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century, they develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in inorganic tissue.
We don't know what that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> twins, or <unk> twins, and <unk> <unk> -- not to be able to have a good physical health for a physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it takes to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity -- he wants to say to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present it a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very close ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very Romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born as two people in one body.
The most high case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test are going to be able to determine whether you're going to be <unk> it's a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such one.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a line line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, we have to admit that these categories -- we thought they were <unk> <unk> categories that are going to spread directly with <unk> categories are much more <unk> than they were born.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out to be much more complicated than the informal terminology that it is.
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as it comes to the science of science, we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set out a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today, not in the public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to engage with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of he would get a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved you not <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma really -- and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I am progressive, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
We would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension I had to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and brave and so radical in what they did, that I find myself looking at that musical <unk> and not because of the music, it's totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
Founding Founding <unk> -- for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did was that they were a <unk> concept, and it was linked to another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we're going on, our Founding <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming out of the law of blood passed from grandfather to father and then to the son, etc.
Parents was rejected by the idea and replacing it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
And they decided that the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were going to have two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time we would turn the science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed through a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence is talking about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
What about women <unk>
Then it came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people who are talking to the <unk> coincidence of the <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should help the anatomy.
I don't want to say that at five years of five people were supposed to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> that for me have sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them is, born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, Henry, in the contrary, was born in term: June 1, he was born at March June 1 1980.
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary are attributed to attribute all of the rights three months before Henry -- the right -- the right to the sex consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because I have a different age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, Henry, in virtue of being considered <unk> if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered <unk> is now <unk> of the compulsory <unk> that Mary don't have to worry about.
Mary, for her hand, doesn't have the same rights to same-sex marriage, for instance.
Henry can marry every states, with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So I still had <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science goes so much in the field of the anatomy that we arrive at about to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going to get off.
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude.
But a lot of people are caught in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided to get married with a man you don't have to have the chromosome -- and that to marry a woman you have to have chromosome Y.
Now, in practice, they don't make tests for people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you at the beginning of the syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, <unk> <unk> it offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sex relationships than 40 that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that America will continue to drive this current thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who is attracted to be attracted to other men is to be susceptible to being <unk> unless he is willing to have a change of sex, in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a light twins and then they pick them out, and then they break their name.
But when the phone asked him the concept of the operation was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, he has considered the political asylum instead of separation <unk>
America offers enormous possibilities for people to be who are without <unk> to change the day of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to finish up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> -- particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in studying sexual differences.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And so years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism feminism -- I was considered a feminist, a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what have the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
feminism has to get rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing women's in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, more of the things that there is some female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more than complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the fathers were very proud to find the way to protect people from the state, it is possible that we have been putting more attached to this concept, we might have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy beyond <unk> think less in terms of identity -- in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So while we try to create a better part, think of what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, and it has a chance to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily translate the world to <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just ran out of buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments would be owners, and that the other half is still not <unk> to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to be doing <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you have is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have standards to avoid the <unk> and the causes of building conditions.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, and we build a whole new apartment building completely new and when the standards of that place would be building the construction instead of putting them in.
So I proposed that the governments -- new reform areas to contain cities and gave them a name, cities.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would crawl out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the following presidential elections in the following election, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we would use reforms and at the same time at the same time.
He asked <unk> to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those standards that say you can't go and bother to all the current residents of apartments.
We need a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of our technologies to <unk> and they are usually the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They would call.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we were meeting in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, land which, in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which is going to be there and a choice so that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those policy.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I introduced another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which included an image like this, which was going to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
It's just this airport over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, we need to start with a site that was measuring at least 1,000 miles square.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can provide new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be able to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And we also collect new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from countries associated with them that would help them to establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all be able to trust the <unk> of effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
I could easily get a thousand square miles.
And little later, the 19 percent of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> the Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special special regions to happen.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in the favor of this constitutional constitutional <unk>
All the parties, all the features in society, <unk>
In the <unk> it has to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17th, passed again on a <unk> voting on one.
Immediately after the voting on the 21st of 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's building in Korea -- is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was been built in four years, after four years ago getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've done two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow managers to die, and they would allow the operating under a external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the end of the last ultimately for this new <unk> system.
There's urban planners and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of residents.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There are a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go to work -- sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothing.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you seem to think about insist on that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friend <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently I photograph and publishing on my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The <unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet <unk> people, usually my money goes to a good <unk> and my point is <unk> and buy it into my personal <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
I'll like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would expect, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone to have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
It's inside for a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after I was here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know what the woman you walk through TED in clothes,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure in not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see well.
You almost always see you a phenomenal deal of 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in a week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
You just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get married as well.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're carrying in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to be a game <unk> or I remind them to their little age of seven.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key one.
If you think you look at something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood the meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there's no look that you can't be able to <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth for you: The gold <unk> are going with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a own personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried it again and again when people were approaching me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I am going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> to these things, because at the end corner, there will always be another suit, <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I find it up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical person.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some whistled through one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that as most of the other quantum quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is the one that says one thing can be just in a place at time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a little kid in a parking little <unk>
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet you play with that parking bar, he taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things not allow them to be able to stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars -- play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find that they do all kinds of really strange things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point, the physics was a few years behind, you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But they didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit it very well to my intuition, and it may be because it's not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But she didn't fit my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it didn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a very good approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal <unk> with a springboard and <unk> in a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would have a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and <unk> all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this hole with a <unk> form that sits under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on a full piece of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator I do all sorts of rare things, but then when other people come up to do those things, because I don't want to get those things, because I don't want to get them back, or actually, I am."
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of <unk> objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes through and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that was what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then you take it at a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little bit of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their motions.
We discovered that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way they were <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which is expanding and <unk>
And by giving you a soft drive, we were able to make it happen, and that we didn't get at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is this is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is, and you don't know at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillions of atoms that make up that metal piece are still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because look at this, the difference in a scale between one atom and that little metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, this is my logic that he talks about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you get your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we turn it out, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just going to fold in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that true.
is more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define you who are. And that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months and 18 months old.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is simply about this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't have any access to many of these museums and art artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working at Google, trying to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Maybe I show the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've carried out from their launch.
So let's get to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery gallery and the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very straightforward.
We click and we click on, we are already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall, right?
Come on, go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I didn't get to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, is about 10,000 million pixels.
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get to 10,000 billion <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression is not a price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I met with something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems to be <unk>
I came up and discovered that children were actually playing something.
And I talked to a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the picture, so you see really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is a painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going quickly to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and they really do that.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk> night, I think he had never seen it as well before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite features.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online line your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming in.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things -- send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my mind, they even come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They come from those artists.
And that's been my humble humble experience.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to its art and it's represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You can do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian all the children in Italy -- grow with this picture on her bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that there was something very interesting something that has happened in Formula City races in the last two decades.
Some of the time, if you wanted to win a career for Formula One, I took a budget and you would take it to a good pilot and a good car, a good car, and a good car, a good car, and a good car, a good car, and a good car, a good car, and a good car, a good car, and a good car, a good car, and
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering, it would be <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the real-time control systems are beginning to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're going to be becoming outdoor computers.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can tell, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex -- but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
Seventy-five percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
So in a way, it's like almost all of the atoms would become sensors and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a certain sense, it's almost like the old <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end, he took the hammer and threw it up in the Moses -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, "Come on <unk> "For <unk> and he said, "What not <unk>
Well, today, our own environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and push something out.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup the year.
Maybe some of you remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end he won Italy.
Now what happened now is what happened that day by looking at activity happens in the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the early afternoon there are people over here, and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
They were able to get people up a quick phone call to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
<unk> First time <unk>
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night they were all at the middle of the center.
You see the great summit.
The next day they were all at the center of the winning team and the first minister of time.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people are going to be a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city pulse in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we use.
Today, we know all about the origins of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it will be <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the garbage in their change through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are in all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
A week.
With this information we realized there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are really complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that <unk> not away, is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day still still there.
If we showed that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change of <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talk at the first part that we talked about in the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago.
And it all began with a question of Mayor of the city, who came up and told us that Spain and the southern of Europe has a beautiful tradition of the use of the water in public spaces, in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> valves open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels can be written in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We introduced this to the Mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot of it.
And they would take a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There's no doors no windows but when you close it up, it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> your ceiling.
Or you can close the building, and all the architecture disappears as in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof goes down, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost the whole architecture goes away.
Here it is.
You see the people who are looking at what happens in.
And here I'm myself trying not to figure out the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way you interact had a little bit.
It wasn't a building that would open to let you go, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in and one had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of using our designs in our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw earlier, that moves with other in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
And a kind of flexible display like this with a normal space in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, in which what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine that the screen appears on different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of the pixels in 3D where you can close, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When light, you see this. The same thing that we saw before.
Imagine one of them <unk> a person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, the motion of people, and so on, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet dancers.
Here we can see, dancing.
On the left, you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time <unk>
It can turn all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels with them, with the color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called La <unk>
And the idea is, can you imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our metabolic environment as an oyster nursery like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make it a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign. We can move from the digital world of power, the power of the <unk> power to the physical world.
In our case, this might be we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how do you move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixels.
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom and serve to share the major moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a connection to the community.
So, it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, as a new top of London.
You can get there there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that being a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose you would say that with only some changes in your genes, they could make it better for more accurate more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of ourselves?
What about the good health?
Or maybe those people who were always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that I am going to tell you about.
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people will hire creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably owe to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you want <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of them makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe is that possible?
Evolution has been a unified topic here at the TED Conference and today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great geneticist of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay entitled "No in biology makes sense except for the light of the <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: just about the past, or the future?
refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the one thing that interests us.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it is the same protein, that comes out of the <unk>
And talk about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when you Antonio <unk> it raises the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully detailed environment for those bacteria.
It's warm and dark <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort in it.
It's really like a quick pathway to the bacteria with the occasional disruption of any rush <unk> towards the output.
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients from <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what would the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope that you've got it.
When I first went to college I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the grace and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the organisms, every cell simply divide and all the genetic energy from that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
<unk>
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that goes through the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the death of the body is in evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> was a lot of reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, every time I was <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still ran in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night he hits their front door to their hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a magnificent dancing dancer, <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> it looks for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, George, he says <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal of the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to healthy us.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think they would all be able to do the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily contribute to longevity.
They don't necessarily attend the greatest or the stronger or the stronger and the more intelligent and the smarter.
Evolution favors creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean of the ocean of the ocean -- the bacteria that are able to survive on the heat of the <unk> that they would have, if there were fish that would be <unk> <unk> <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if you go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward, to the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we could fit ourselves as we adapt to it.
And by the way, by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it is no longer possible to have the <unk> necessary to evolution happen.
A second possibility is that you can produce an evolution of traditional traditional type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they are <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when the species -- distant planets are going to have the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility that it might be, intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but it is what it takes at the individual and family level.
So you can also think that if it was possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic modifications to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to do those changes on your genes.
If you look at the future that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome began in 1990 and he was 13.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of it, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost close to 20,000 and a week.
Not so much to make the human genome actually <unk> and be more and more to the reach of all.
They come those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses not only are going to protect us but they're going to behave <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu flu -- in the cells of a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today, and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine only two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and <unk> or to change the <unk> <unk> and give her children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, remove the <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who wants to do more <unk>
And then that same analytical technology, that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases it will also allow us to have a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you were able to <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a rush muscle to allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years and we can take 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options in a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, let's pick up selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform, or more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these advanced decisions.
For better or better for worse, and before what it might be, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall <unk>
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine making <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one that I could talk to about flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already taken the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the way.
They ran the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
And the three words I think I heard before.
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life will spread.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before he died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get in and didn't, all the fences that wanted to <unk> all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I got a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to spend anything in life.
And that way, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the George Washington Bridge was a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity as well as my ego.
And I am sorry for the time that we were able to focus on things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought of my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I've never had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have the reason -- <unk> being <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> 14, 14th <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, <unk> <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I <unk> I had a feeling of, wow, dying is not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> as a little.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
And at that point, I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, I didn't die that day.
And I was awarded another gift that was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in a way.
You are flying today, the challenge you are flying today, challenge you to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be like this -- but you can imagine, and how do we <unk>
What is it that they don't expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy on them?
And most importantly, they're being the best fathers to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation like that, obviously, graffiti is intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody who's important and have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Someone saw the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way -- you will take your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check and rather than that signed a check that I had no idea how it was going to <unk>
I teamed up with her brother and her father in that precise moment, "All right, this is the Tony <unk> is going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get it back to do his art again.
Because it's a ridiculous thing that someone who has so much inside your inner cannot afford it.
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research who has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw on that and record negative space.
So they're going through making art facilities like this.
All of the things that they are, they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization would move things from one side to another we've achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies and we get a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's more <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't do it. This guy's <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers around the world -- from every single corner of the world to our home.
My wife, the children and I, moved into the front of and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we would do something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken the walls and instead there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> -- my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> sunlight that we buy in the shipping walk in <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it into a light light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds up -- we published the code -- the software goes down in a <unk>
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There's no insurance to say "No."
There's no hospital that I can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only his eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was impressive.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the room of <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of research sessions of all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and he's looking through the support system of his life.
We gave him the bed to be able to see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti too.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what would say, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, it will be <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but this is the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and <unk>
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything goes out of our own pockets.
The awards went to the guy, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong was something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up about closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of the things in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing possible at a time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I did nothing with <unk> <unk> technology, I just recognized something and I was fascinated with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we encounter something that we feel that we need to do is -- if it's not now, I'm going to go, if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in the way in situations generally very difficult and at the same time a very dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating a lot of fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been focusing on awful situations with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that we can make social attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you see useful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple weeks ago, I got a <unk>
I emailed some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights to the name of my TEDTalk <unk>
What I was doing was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what and according to content could be involved in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to get it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So still with that <unk> I knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked him a year ago, I would not have been able to ask for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working, we tested the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could have been able to do it for something that could be so difficult or so dangerous as to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that treating the <unk> of product and marketing and advertising, and that the whole film would be <unk> with products of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The biggest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The greatest film never <unk> is that all of the top at the end of the end -- it has a whole series of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the brand X.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> to <unk> forever.
And so the film looks at all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that <unk> all categories that we can on the film.
Maybe you had a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe that you had <unk>
The most cool car you had driven in "The greatest film ever <unk> the best drop you had <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, making them that <unk> the <unk> -- MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea -- all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how to <unk> it is going to be the people there.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you look, it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a half and a half ago, I think it's going to be difficult the meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the movie comes to us as a whole bunch of loose idiots ...
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
And Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: So both of both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So, I was <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: What I thought was -- <unk> meant having a conversation out of a microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one for once, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of us wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the idea of advertising, was to introduce the product as many people as possible, to make so many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media <unk> is not the idea to have that new vehicle worth of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>    -- this is one of the first images that came up.
I like your way from <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices -- the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to making it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency.
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but we want <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was telling me in some lie -- and he's looking at me as he used to be used -- said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, and it's my story, and it's real <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanted to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take out of the proxy and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
So what I started to point out of a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I've got friends that make big, big, giant big, many people make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies say that the reason their films have so successful is due to the associated marks that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk>
And the film is called "The greatest film ever <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can say "You're good for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there it wouldn't give one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have the opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as for <unk> <unk> <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We're a little <unk>
Let's give the kind of smaller film movies that <unk> we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people is the reason that this interests us.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you can do in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you very cool.
How do you keep you fresh longer? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the guy from the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: I remember my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: reviving the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is from <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something like <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like dark colors, a lot of gray gray and things like this.
And usually I wear accessories a <unk> or I like the crystals and the same <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Part of it is partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet <unk>
<unk> toys for pets and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we don't all be able to be Tom, Tom, but often <unk> me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
He needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me of that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you are looking at how people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come together, and they start in a place and in my case start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What is the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your shape.
MS: It's like who wants to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> to what we do is that?
What is the <unk> What is that phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you are, who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to say fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. <unk> <unk> hey, yeah. Thank you very much.) All right. <unk>
MS: Yes, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> in your personality of <unk> brand <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand <unk>
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going into one of their strong points or in the other rather than focus on both.
A lot companies tend to do -- and it's nature's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> they are trying to avoid the fear of those elements, and you are actually <unk> and you make it become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see this to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks -- all of those things that have gone and come and come up with a <unk> is a pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to <unk> your brand, your brand, you might be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're someone who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> attribute <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are like being playful to be playful as <unk> contemporary products, or bold or bold as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical and <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
You're a <unk> sophisticated <unk>
You're traditional established, <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You are reliable, stable, familiar, safe, sacred, sacred, or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mostly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as a movie movies.
We went to St. Paulo where they have forbidden outdoors in the open.
Throughout the city for the last five years, there's no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are making up on the schools with money problems in America.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the most successful response, or the ones I've been most successful is the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took them to the <unk> they took their donor agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did he gone? they did <unk>
Well, since the movie was released at <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million sketches on the media for this film.
This covers just a <unk> period, a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
He's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to gain momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we're talking about: their customers won't be <unk>
I've always believed that if you take any risk if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people that's pushing it to failure.
I think when you train their employees at the loss of risk loss is preparing all your company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, we're going to go forward, I think we need to give it place to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is <unk> the risk.
From <unk> at a time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to house transparency.
Today, more than never a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my <unk> talk has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: And so, <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check from the extracellular matrix of the TED matrix, the Foundation Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for the TED year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are in a completely different technology.
But if we can put a cash available virus from Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, so we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, damages the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission mission.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we would embrace our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they spent very strange things.
They were <unk> as a laboratory of lab that he didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then I was experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is effectively working on that place: on.
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
We'd better take your goal to soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two light pumps -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had the entire internal information.
We would have all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me say, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample from this attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were calls for the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and <unk> and we were trying to address the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass on or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- remember, which is definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white <unk> because it's where most infection has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
And I called them and I went to an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked quite well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you deal with the speed of this <unk> they can actually <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to get to the nest engineers that they couldn't do that quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows in that code, you can't get it off.
I started to investigate scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust in understanding what we had in our hands.
So I didn't have any <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> were to one single single goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what is <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals to be <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I was really surprised.
There is the gray, and up up the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values of the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still run during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds by video <unk>
It's <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just to push the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act quickly.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine is happening, you must open <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And we don't have the <unk> and the security system <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Consider this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have a lot of <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
We can make it as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what I was doing, it's a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the implication we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All of the green areas are spaces with great number.
We need to face the consequences and better than we start making now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, they really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the Greek superpower here.
There is one story, and that's the United States, fortunately, we <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to give it and give you <unk> or other people that make a wheelchair get up and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
These are nothing different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force -- that will also increase your speed, and aid, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and connect to the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, should take on their back a <unk> load of pounds, and it's becoming <unk> to get more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injury on their back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with broken <unk>
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton that I can take 90 pounds for variables for many hours.
Her flexible design allows us to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and a <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the way back to the users of addicted and comfortable users of what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in <unk> chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens in very often young people with the damage to start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that you are getting to be added to be very quickly.
Her only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
So let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago in the neocortical column and as a result he couldn't go back to 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has a few sensors.
Not <unk> on the crutches that send signals on the computer on board, here on the back.
There are also some batteries here giving the motors into the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft and very natural floor.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing down the bottom of it <unk>
On a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all <unk> <unk>
Little time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never get to <unk>
That was 19 years ago.
So I stole the last little amount of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since, it's allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs <unk> and even riding rocks and <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just from soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of addicted and <unk>
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> sex to say hello, and the game is the order of day -- where fun is a serious thing.
And no, it's not the <unk> <unk> festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, know the cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are alongside the chimpanzees, their living relatives in the galaxy.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known to their <unk>
But unfortunately, we have too much emphasis on this way in our narratives of human evolution.
But the Bonobos show the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by the big guys, <unk> the Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict, has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat, and deforestation are making it not like a stadium with the Bonobos that they stay in the world -- and honestly we are not even sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hidden away the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it like apes, <unk> love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, we love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of social interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the roots in the same side of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just out of the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football game.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> has a <unk> of <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves him, right?
Yes.
So sexual game is common as well as humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing through unusual elements to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female -- who's playing with <unk> water.
I think that we sometimes play ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds inside of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let me peak our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play play -- can be the moments that I'm most urgent as on.
So colleagues for that, fellow primates, we embrace this gift of evolution and play together as they were, creativity, friendship and <unk>
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain a captain in a fire fire volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers to make a highly specialized staff -- one has to get to the site of the very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer at the site, so I had a very high probability of go.
But still there was a race standing against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what was our task.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me -- <unk> <unk> -- he came first to the captain and he asked her to go back and save the dog owner.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I went into a <unk> building in order to save a live -- just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman back a couple shoes away.
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but I was hoping -- I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, and it went into the end of the hall, which was at the end of the hall, and they had finished the fire and went into the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden to the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house treasures for the clothing owner where, as they would expect, their treasure of treasure of mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness she looked at about the other was that someone had gotten a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling for Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer businessman who are a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also the acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
And so, when I look at this room of people who have achieved, or are in <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this: I don't hang on.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you know, now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a park park.
It's mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete is built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement of a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> he came up with this.
It was called <unk> bricks.
And in a few years, the building blocks came to all the home.
It's been estimated that there are more than 400 billion or 75 bricks of every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the block of concrete -- the favorite in the world, and converted it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked around with each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know what the building blocks of our time are happening to the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that you connect through magnets.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the <unk> is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble one blue with one green and very quickly you can begin to make bigger circuits.
A blue one with a green one.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a chip module that is here, and now we have a light light.
We would take this <unk> to create more impact and we have a computer machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, they're actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster and more slow or more slow or more slow, you just turn this button to make your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a dead collection.
We want all interactions in the world to have ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given kids to watch them play with them.
And it has been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, the designers without any expertise in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island, who have no experience any engineering experience, only in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk>
But hang on, here comes my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that she's afraid of the dark.
For these not by the engineers, <unk> it became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the grasp of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company searches to get involved in the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> just for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This isn't ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, you have the time for me.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to work on, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative is called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like some Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them into the Third World we send them into the wild world <unk>
They did great <unk> worked with the employees of <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a fire hydrant in Boston.
Here it appears as if I was looking at a quote, but what really looks for is that someone is caught by the snow because it knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for this so <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members named Erik <unk> noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> in front of them.
So he made as a good programmer, he developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You hold <unk> when <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put him back.
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
So, it is a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications of <unk> last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> to see this application realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It is very important that these <unk> of the tsunami, but people are <unk> the batteries.
That's why citizens are asking the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago was just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when I <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are able to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they made the normal channels that would have taken at least two years and end up about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the heart of California that until time has cost 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that has been program in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot warning for the institution of the government.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, and <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a collective institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given through the government.
They feel a great frustration in front of that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And it is that if we left aside the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that we put together with the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> and what we do together because it alone doesn't work.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you, because things are changing.
The politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately produced by us -- remember that <unk> the <unk> how to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, about <unk>
This is the center of a service of services and information.
It's the place that the phone calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This call.
He joined the official knowledge <unk>
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put very strong music to see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and a mobile, called <unk> <unk>
You don't have that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this actually comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my cube.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good night, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical thing.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to collaboration in distributed motion.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get married and help others.
So one citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could have been connected with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor help another one, we <unk> the communities.
If we call the control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
An important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as the policy.
A lot of people are <unk> but you think one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is vote.
How many times have we chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will embrace our values and make our needs, but then we don't see change.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is this <unk> which holds us that we've funded as an funded as something that is that we are against, that other thing, and a consequence we're missing is power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the actual work is happening.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You've got them <unk>
This is a group of citizens worried that have written a very detailed report on response to the request of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That is not political activism -- it's <unk> activism.
And for those of us who are facing government, it's time for us to ask, what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root function of government so that it can be expanded to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and he knows it's not that hard to act <unk> only we have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of the age of our members is about 28 years old, so I am a older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that all of us are facing who are going to get <unk> they're going to talk about.
They can express your views at any channel and do it.
And so when the government problem is not very much to make hear your voices.
They're using hands.
They hand hands in order to program applications that will work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use your hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking away <unk> <unk> a garbage dump that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were able to have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we are not only consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get to <unk> the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will be <unk>
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, jails and death row.
I've spent most of my life in new communities in projects and places where there is a lot of desperation.
And I'm here at TED, watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
Occasionally, if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
This is why I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in all of us in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia on the <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way we saw the world.
She was a <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit of a little bit, and I looked at it, she was approaching and I was a good hug for me.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then I got off.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I would give it to me again, and if I said yes, I was leaving myself.
I had this human quality that would always wish you to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Occasionally, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running all over.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him and she goes, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, and he took me up and said, "Come on, <unk> <unk> are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "It was <unk> I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do?"
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just I want you to do three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I was going to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said, "I see the second thing I want to tell you about, is that you will always do the right thing if the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never get to <unk>
And I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> like that.
I grew up in the field, in the South rural. I have a brother and a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us grabbed my sister and and went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, I'm not going to get <unk>
My brother said, <unk> I <unk> I <unk> and you always do the same thing as we are.
I took something, your sister would have a <unk>
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I got a look at me with strength and said, "Oh, not being that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit, I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking that it's a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My cough were dying of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should be <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people at parole.
And this massive <unk> in my mind, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor or black communities are found so much <unk> as much of these facts.
One of three blacks between 18 and 30 years is in prison or the parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, California, 50 to 60 percent of all young people are in prison or for parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and guilty. than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not for us.
We are <unk>
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work in some good developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you tell you for always if you have an criminal glamour.
Right now, in Alabama, of the <unk> of male male male has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights is going to be as high as it was before I was able to get the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence by 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, without a chance to come out again.
We're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
I would get people in the death row.
This issue of death row is interesting.
In a certain sense, they've been able to think that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for the <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
From every nine persons <unk> has identified one which is innocent and released from the death row.
It's a rate of error, which is an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation wouldn't it allow you to ever be able to fly if from every nine to <unk> one would have been <unk>
But somehow we get away from the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of this issue that we deserve to kill.
Interestingly, in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terror, the age that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a very defined <unk>
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were concerned about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell talks, you ask people to stop saying that in our story for the first time with terror, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, <unk> Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial racial and of separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And this is why we have not understood what we have historically done.
All of the time we can do with each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome racial segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving the death penalty show.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's well disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> we have no death in Germany.
We will never be here."
The hall was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and <unk> we would put us to <unk>
Let's get on top of this.
How would we be in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in the majority of <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult, things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We have been fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But then lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, for abuse, of <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, it is necessary to integrate both of those.
I've been talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that is within our being.
We really have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so rational, with the intellectual <unk>
By innovation, with creativity. The development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas as well as the convictions of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not only in the bright and <unk> but also the dark and hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay with due attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege being a very young lawyer of meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, the Iranian lady called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I do."
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about death penalty <unk>
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got a finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much like but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst that we've ever observed.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't care about it, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in people who must be pushed by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't think of our technology, for our designs, or our intellectual and rational capacity.
At the end of the course of a society, not the character of a society, not how they treat rich and powerful richer, but because of the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I get too much power.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my customers for 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> for them as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge will turn someone into what isn't it?
The judge would be an adult, but I see a boy.
A very late night I was awake at God, if the judge can become something that doesn't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old client -- a little, poor, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black client is treated as a privileged white white, executive in a <unk>
In <unk> I put there that there was been some <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical -- but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or actually <unk>
For my horror, not only <unk> it was sent to a cut.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally said, "My God, I have to go to the court for this stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. He walks the court.
I was climbing the stairs when I found a black man <unk> it was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. I said yes.
And so I approached it and <unk>
And I stood up on the ear, and I was surprised.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When he walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we started argue.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They get the policemen the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- they're all infuriated because we talked about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we are talking about inequality.
At the eye of the eye, I reached out to see the <unk> that was going to be and <unk>
I looked out the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man with a concern, of concern, went into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break of a <unk> <unk> he showed up because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black black.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, he looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young man who keeps his view in the target <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly <unk> if we don't care about human rights and the dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our views of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> at <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help the audience to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several chance close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to get the funds that are spent today in politics of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases didn't get in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, the security <unk>
I think there's a very close chance.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think that is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
Great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war.
That's why this is a dramatic increase in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain by stealing a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making it easier to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about here today.
You are very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Voice 2: The threats by Bin Laden.

<unk> 4: <unk> <unk> <unk> 5: <unk>
<unk> 6: Uh, social.
<unk> <unk> <unk> 9: <unk>
Several <unk> war.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media would prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than surviving, the first stop of all that data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So of course, from a <unk> of stories, <unk> to look at the negative.
That old saying, "If there are blood, you know, it's very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's no surprise that people think that the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe, instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps huge progress has done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying we don't have our good problems problem, the climate change, the scarcity of species, the scarcity of water and <unk> we have no doubts the time.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long run, we end up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average average per capita adjusted to inflation, has <unk> all over the world.
<unk> mortality has reduced times.
Furthermore, the cost of food, of the electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy happened from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people are <unk>
And we still have higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we can do the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, mobile conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is technology, and then there is this exponential growth.
My good Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put in information technology <unk> on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
For that reason, your mobile phones are a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing is -- in good, bad times, in the war and peace, in a recession and the <unk>
It's the end of the speed of speed used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> about Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends from <unk> call endless computing, sensors and networks, robotics, the robotics, 3D printing and the ability to democratize personalized production on the whole planet, synthetic biology, the fuels the vaccines and food, digital medicine -- the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" of Watson, of <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspaper the best headline I had.
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on the mobile phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can impact the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have a absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think of creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every day on the planet, it's about creating a life of how possible.
Is that going to take it out that it's fair and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon were <unk> and <unk> <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is about aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal way.
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he did the aluminum thing that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet -- by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They arrive at the Earth 16 percent of the energy in <unk>
It is not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar fell 50 last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk now about the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spaceship on the Earth, in 1990, then it passed away.
It was a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, that two percent is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes <unk> <unk>
So in a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I was allowed to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator in the air.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water in a day of any source of water, <unk> polluted water -- at least two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just known that I'm going to make a significant test of the hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence in which this is how it will be, Coca-Cola is in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation by this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart mobile phone, he has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
They better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video books, video books, and music, technology -- <unk> technology, <unk> technology, <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe you might get the best one of the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we have these technologies on a mobile device with which they speak, and because it has <unk> can be extracted from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there's no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that will not be able to call the health care and first of all, to stop the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connecting them together.
By 2020, we spend two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds had never been able to get to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you do? What wishes to you?
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Academy -- and because of the use of impressions in 3D and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can three billion of humanity, healthy members and healthy and <unk>
How about a voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What did these three billion <unk>
What if they are <unk> we cannot <unk>
One of the things that I learned with the Prize, is that small, guided equipment for a target of course, can do things that were before they could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this college teachers with each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has been shown today the machinery of human patterns is better to folding proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds and we have new minds to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few recent decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'm going to give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that they were <unk> but it wasn't like this.
<unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it very much until the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about the Galapagos.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 steps, the black beard <unk>
And the fishing fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was made more from the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the number of fish had declined in half.
I went to the five inches.
They have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish still were happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> at the introduction of the deep-sea fishery in Southeast Asia.
In the decade of 1970 -- he started in <unk> Europe did a lot of developing projects.
The fishing development was imposing to countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fisheries.
And this kind of nice boat, kind of called the <unk> 4.
I went out to fishing in it, and we did studies in the South Sea of China -- and especially in the Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And the vast majority of the fish are tiny blobs on these things -- the remains that are fish of coral reef.
The bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study, and then you start the commercial fisheries.
The bottom is about being a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead turtle, dead.
Not the <unk> because they were <unk>
One time we captured a alive.
He was still not <unk>
So they wanted to get it out, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that they collect fishermen whenever they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there's no documented.
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
They would take the start point to start, at new level, without remembering what was there.
So if you look, this is something like this.
On the axis, and we have <unk> things, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time, it changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as they do, and they extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk>
And at the end of the end, keeping a dead remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
One loses little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous with large fish.
They are <unk> because they are <unk>
Over time, we have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence introduced in a way earlier -- is not the way they would expect to be evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> such as Captain as captain as a captain can be used in this area cannot be used or generally they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in inorganic societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that it can perform a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really <unk> the past.
And so you know, the past that people can't think of because the starting point has been run and it's incredibly low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase its point <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe can fill in the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there was gray whales in <unk> bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people are <unk> with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, it's to Cameron, making <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are making viral and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today online video makes any of us, or our actions, I come from this notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can do famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of YouTube video per minute.
And of those, only a little percentage of it becomes viral is getting lots of visits and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this film shot out of his house in the National Park National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This chart shows the views in the rise of popular summer last summer.
<unk> didn't try to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had posted a lot of the nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> I published this tweet that I was going to get to her very much.
<unk> of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new things and interesting things to a wider audience.
RS: It's Friday Friday. You all want you to get on the end of the week,   Everyone wants you to get the end of a week,   <unk> Friday, shooting on your Friday.  KA: You won't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Black RS: It's one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
Just like you were going to add up, this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday,
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group creators embrace a point of view, and they share with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great inner joke and then start talking about that and do things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the scientific entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an amazing animation.
That's it. That's it.
This year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that is rare, you know there's a <unk> version that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the online community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the ancient version.
And then it became international leadership.
Suddenly, I came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a stupid joke.
Because today it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted to be predicted by <unk> <unk> or RS: <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written to be written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video you go up with a video for minute, only the only unexpected thing can be unexpected in the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to do this big video of a kind of protest against <unk> to New York City, I admit, I didn't really get interested in.
Casey Casey <unk> me by not circular for the <unk> but often there are obstacles that are allowed to you properly <unk>
KA: Thank your surprise to the surprise and to your humor, Casey <unk> I managed to have five million of you saw and understand their idea.
So this is why this approach is worth doing a creative way.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities of participation, the creative communities of participation, are features of a new kind of media, where we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said earlier, one of the <unk> Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Not <unk> permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media, are barely the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long, friends, are <unk>
It was stuck in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother has never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to get it, but I would know it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn, <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task, the escape from his family and a new new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do this.
And then from a <unk> of four years that challenges fiction, a boat gets slid into the sea of hot ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the pirate rape and death.
As most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk>
If we were going, we first would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the motor dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil chart in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and he died, the journey was too much to get it, and the first apple I tried -- given for the men in the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to shape a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of class <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants together.
Unlike the suburbs of the middle class, whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of right.
The smells that were coming from stores were the rest of the world.
And the number of English English is <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working six days.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title at IT <unk> of the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what you should be <unk> which was usually <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go back home.
At home, where?
Something in me was <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we ran over our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered from <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until the nightmares of the <unk>
She opened a computer store, then he studied to be <unk> and opened up another business.
And women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition angry and <unk> and <unk> kids caught between two worlds.
They looked at subsidies and <unk>
They were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical student relentless with what I <unk> myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, increasingly, <unk> by violence, abuse and <unk>
But many people got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer and they chose the young Australian student.
And I was <unk> of a piece of the puzzle on the other, but the edges, not <unk>
As a resident anonymously at <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist and a social activist invited to talk about places that I never heard of, and in houses whose existence had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when we got into the ship.
He hadn't ever been an option.
<unk> he said, "What do you not be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more I was like, most of all, it was a lot to talk about it.
I met people of all of the paths of life, many of them doing what they were living on the border of as possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career of <unk>
It had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger -- a little bit in the scene -- and not only it's right, but it's something that being grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being in it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be, but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> were <unk>
There was one energy there, a rare optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
They would take a little group of people who <unk> <unk> cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we had a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant soup of soup that we all had.
<unk> up to the good entry at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I was <unk> and the adventure.
Before finally, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without her husband, he caused a <unk> <unk> and bringing the cause, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't have proved it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a <unk> hotel when she died, a thousand miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a few minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple.
We tell stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from <unk> he said.
"You haven't got it yet.
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us were and how life came to us, we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have embraced it.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could want that to do? Right?
Yet, I'm afraid of the easy privilege of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> brave in every wave, the <unk> rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them a lot, and you can see it safe, would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here, in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> a few years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and put the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when I <unk> the great prince of Indian, he was <unk> pull out an arc and a <unk> on the ground, they could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that makes me a lot of my mind.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was fascinated with this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't tell my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to be <unk>
My grandfather gave me his father <unk> his silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for me the most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had a sense of mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it to be.
Tell us our inspiration.
And so I was <unk> I was sent to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
And they put the text with the image of the image, scanning sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what do we do for that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  It says, "This box is <unk> <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
And at various moments, I get a <unk> the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little girl inside of all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and celebration of it but to that magic of childhood to those ideas that we would teach of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me up and so exciting to me.
So, over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release the fireflies.
And they actually light your way into what the subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with as a child was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag to this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always been maps but static maps have always been maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, it's also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content, and contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard about fairies and <unk> but how many people outside of India know their counterparts of <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, on an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a child child <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out there, and take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a kid I had a lot of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So in order to recover this childhood ritual that we have to go out and in a chapter -- a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This creates a digital collection of photos that then can be put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been gone.
Within the variations of connection between magic, the Earth and technology is so many possibilities.
And in the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and video on and through augmented reality -- you see a <unk> group that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of wind and be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are going to occur with technology and magic and technology is close to another.
<unk> power of the sun.
We're close to our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and love that we sit together through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> a director of listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a small cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we care?
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or perhaps not all, but most of the <unk> projects fail, we just stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale that's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob and <unk>
Every morning I woke up.
And yeah, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to a <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my body problem is -- not at the same time that I need <unk> or any urgency to that style but to see it backwards.
But there is something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I would go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also that patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week to be available from next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to take away from their homes, they will take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients take a position, they come back to recover the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges we face -- like the firing of the costs of attention, <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but it's also through <unk>
And one of the things we had to share with you with you with a video of you.
We all have checks in <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know exactly where the ATMs in <unk>
And where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
So what we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to see a <unk> please get <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in a kind of <unk> office and they're closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to search for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone -- and to the next few weeks using their cellphone <unk> to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just as a <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish we would be <unk>
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us to help us to work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, can find it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in place.
Please forgive us in this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
And I mixed up with my previous passion for the drawing, but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk>
For me the photograph had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
And so I wanted to create something different, a process that started the press <unk>
So let's start with this one: a construction road on a very <unk>
But he has an unexpected turn.
And even though it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful to the time but with the common goal of keeping the art level.
And when I say realism I mean <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can get, but I always want to have been captured in some way as photography.
<unk> where you will have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with getting a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
Put my light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the principles are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way they can create something that still seems like <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
It really involves these different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem like realistic I think they're those in that we don't even hear the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important, because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will go to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same thing.
Second, the photos have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images are done with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with perfect love.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is <unk>
Here's another example.
You might think this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely comprised of photographs of different places.
And in the personal level, I think it's easier to create a place that will find it, because you don't need to put the ideas that has in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yeah, even I made the house on top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So in order to achieve a realistic outcome, I think we need planning.
You start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos you know, the result can be very beautiful and to the very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram I took of a folder from mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details -- but the big aspect of the stuff.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this is a lot of other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves that is new.
Here's something weird.
And that's just going to talk about it.
Please switch on the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are you going to use technology on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve, you know, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you -- the diagram would look something ludicrous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't mean a lot.
But if you look, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve would be very <unk> we'd see a straight line.
But if something happens to something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of <unk> transport technology as fast as we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go into that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development of economic growth, that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that you don't follow forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or do you turn into a typical curve, I know how to come up with something totally different, or maybe I'm going to do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, and I think maybe something like this.
From being like that, now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is what that new way <unk>
What new state is going to go to the world?
The transition looks very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember a child that was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, across my life.
But I think it's because we have to feel that something is going on.
And we can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different that they extrapolate -- what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about two billion years ago when the Earth was a huge <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that <unk> around them.
So if we look at the way that we organize those chemicals we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there is some theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and it is that, at that moment, it had floating on some oil oil with all kinds of prescriptions inside of it.
Some of those blobs of oil contain a particular combination of chemicals that made those materials from the outside and so that the droplets grew grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the largest mobile forms -- those <unk> oil.
But those droplets weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them had a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we had.
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow became better at the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemists and more <unk>
Often they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, very simple, very simple, but things will be interesting to when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the prescription of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without meaning, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, we have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide to the local security people.
But <unk> Tom <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of people who are in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and there'd be spread from the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy.
But then another great step step in which things were going to be very different -- and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information into the cell cells.
I don't know if you know, but the bacteria can trade DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resilient <unk> because the bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and set up a <unk>
From that <unk> or <unk> them together, or whether a community was very successful all individuals in that community were <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up and come up so much that they came together and decided to write the whole prescription of the community board together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different kinds of different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart of the heart, or the muscles of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These were starting to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't get to process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process -- the information that those cell phones built built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time time of evolutionary time.
So one organism could do for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had been built these information processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here -- I'm sitting here with some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in his heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated and we turn it into sound, into sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now went through periods of different periods of <unk> <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape, the video, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that now we built to drive that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we would do before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that told them took a billion years each.
The next stages, nervous system and brain, took a few hundred million years.
Second and so forth, took less than a million years.
And bits like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose, the right word to just name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent medical developments without recent history.
But now we design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk> in a conventional way.
I don't know that it makes every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with <unk> designers we think about, we think of a level of abstraction and we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that I didn't do it, it gets much further away and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
And we say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million randomly sequences.
You could run these random instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those that more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tell you numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to tidying numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that random random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, fortunately, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random random sequences that better did the <unk>
They would take those things to the rest.
And now we have the best <unk> the numbers.
And back to <unk> following a process of analog <unk> to the <unk>
So let's take two programs -- that <unk> children, who are <unk> and that children will have the properties of both of these programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's get back again.
They were making some mutations ...
And it tries to try and try and forth with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that generate a completely perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They are dark dark programs.
But do it meet <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I was walking on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to deliver a flight -- you don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when you get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering that is.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they were <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment to analogous to the organisms, when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we're all part of the creation of what it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of coming out, <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great team of baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you have heard it.
It's called <unk>
And we talk about 300 -- from a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat was <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who is going to get to the first base -- you don't get to time and the second base will be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 <unk> it <unk>
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the Los League <unk> League <unk> in a regular season in a regular season.
Now I would take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon that has a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that you live in a place away and a beloved <unk> has two <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know something?
She's getting a lot of better this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I would ask them to ask you.
What do you think should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon, or a <unk> <unk>
Okay. OK.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is send to the world, and I would include the <unk> of being perfect.
You never, ever make a mistake and figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was in my medical school school.
I was a Jewish student,
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs studied to a blood test.
You know.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the University of nurses in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class from anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the differential -- frequent and <unk>
And even I knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the more and more knowledge.
And I was very excited, I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the medical school with the impression that if you were trying everything, then I would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because so I would give you the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady to the emergency service where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency point was to go to a cardiologist -- I was going to attend that patient.
And I will report the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both of the side, which I sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions that the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, and these are <unk> and so there's so hard to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it, and I started working on the treatment that I read about.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> <unk> so that it could be able to get liquid off.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I was very good.
And it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes actually.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone, and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring up information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident in my constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be as successful and able to take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake that I made was worse.
And he sent it to her house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my interior which said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse to <unk> the <unk> <unk> "Do you think he's okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that the tall, and the ambulance with the ambulance was taken to their home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I was going to be able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot, where I was my car to go home. So I did something I don't do normally, I don't know.
I went through the emergency service of the road to home.
And there was another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady who was born before, but another one, he said, three words -- those three words that most of the physicians of the physicians of the medical doctors.
Other specialists fear as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients <unk>
The three words is: Can you remember you?
"Have you remember the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back to the edge of death.
And after an hour he arrived at her house, after I got the high school, suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance and brought the ambulance with a <unk> blood pressure, which means a severe shock to it.
I was barely breathing and she was blue.
The emergency staff will get rid of their resources.
They gave it medication to climb blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I was hoping against all of the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that you never know.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they were getting to what was happening.
And on the ninth day, she left her go. Mrs. mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks of years, I was fascinated by it and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it out with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did, but we are bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would get the things to and made sure that I didn't love me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why don't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little to little that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day, he opened up the sky and finally went off, and I was wondering if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself that if I could make the efforts to be perfect for it not to make any more mistakes it would make for those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was an assistant in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got to a man of 25 years with a chest pain.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He took it out of penicillin and sent him to her home.
But as he ran to the door followed by his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my shift from guard, and my head asked me to talk to me in his office.
And I made the three words, it remembers you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I had no <unk>
He had a potentially lethal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but from the upper airline and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He's not gone.
You get paid antibiotics for <unk> and they recovered in a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it would be <unk> at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
We had an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out -- a colleague who was checking to the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, and I called the surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
I read her <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it out, and when I noticed some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, I called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But each of the case <unk> me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant they've been over the last five years.
<unk> force and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't show you and talk about my mistakes -- if I can't find the <unk> to tell me what it really happens, how do you share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- it would have difficulty looking at it to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that say, you can't sleep, and I know that you know, those who have <unk> results and they have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like the antibodies you're starting to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get away from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will become a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a real-time personal study of medical outreach and medical errors to learn as possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto, "Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes are happening every day in which one in 10 medication -- in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where infection infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 Canadian by errors were <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system, where knowledge goes down every two or three years, and we don't have to worry about us.
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect record of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest chest pain, it comes with <unk> eyes, and with breath out of alcohol and all of a sudden, my story is <unk> in contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't have their symptoms as well as way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we moved, and we eliminate all the professionals that are likely to error, well, you don't have no anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> white <unk> white, <unk> art, it's already a custom -- to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, to the head of surgery, you would tell everybody, this is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone to them.
And his students were <unk> <unk> <unk> head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, you know human beings -- you know it, and it's not proud of your mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who are talking about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving and support way that they were all <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes back in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> errors mistakes.
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average number of choices that he says to choose a half a half a half a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in research followed by a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks by those executives and the time that we would make decisions about making these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> work a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the <unk> of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you represent the way that these decisions?
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as a blind person, raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise when you ask a question, if your answer is positive -- please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this supermarket.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to go to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why never I buy nothing?
This is the shelf of the oil <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones who were in <unk> box that were coming from trees.
And I decided to visit the manager and I asked him, "Do you well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists who came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk> hall.
They had a different classes.
They put a post to <unk> just to the entrance to the store.
We put it out there with six <unk> or of 24 flavors and we looked at two things: One, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a passage that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
The ones that stopped when I had <unk> only three percent got to buy <unk>
When they stood when they were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have to <unk> it's less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem with the overload of choices are affecting us right decisions.
So we decided not to decide, even when this didn't happen to us.
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at decisions about savings for retirement of a million Americans, in between 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in looking at if the number of offers of savings plans.
And we found that there was actually a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of funding that there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as wanted to.
And in the plans.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choice, even in that case, there is unintended consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the larger the number of options, more people were expected to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more choice, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we need to be able to optimize the future financial welfare.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative consequences for offering it more and more possibilities.
Now the most likely thing is that we would make the decision that <unk> even though this is against their own interest.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions in finance and in health.
They are more likely to pick up more <unk> even though objectively it gets better.
The main reason is that we would be able to look at that giant array of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations so we can compare and to choose of that awesome <unk>
Today I want to ask you -- four simple techniques that we've collected in one way or another, in different research, so you can try in your business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is that if you decide to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get rid of strange <unk> <unk> there will be a <unk> increase in the costs, and there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a 10 percent rise in sales.
When the corporation Golden <unk> I eliminated the products for fish that are less <unk> and they increased <unk> in <unk> for two largest sales and under costs.
You know that supermarkets today, on average, offered 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, there's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on the tin.
In the global savings world, I think one of the best examples that has emerged about how to handle better choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All employees of Harvard are automatically <unk> to a safe security fund.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 <unk> not 300 or more.
You know often that people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all kinds of options.
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences that there's between those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do your <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to provide the people in this audience a holiday with all paid of the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds, and then I want you to give yourself a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept it.
Are you not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got a little bit more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first turn, that in the second turn, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average, when they use debit card or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it looked more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> staff of <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were getting to a <unk> plan.
The meeting is that we would take a little bit like this, and we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we had to ask the staff to think about the positive things that they would go through their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent, and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine <unk>
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> along the <unk> <unk> can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This classification scheme is totally useless.
The categories need to indicate something to whom they don't have to do the <unk>
And you often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
Who are supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can drive a lot more information than we think about, if you just get it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision -- buy a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that lets <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have <unk> possibilities.
<unk> <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of choice, 56 colors, to a few <unk> to a few <unk>
The other half of the customers are going to go to a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of choices.
And what am I going to do?"
How involved you are.
If the default <unk> button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that are going to have a lot of choices to <unk> the default button over and again and another one.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they are still there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though you choose the box of changes not to say anything about the preferences of <unk> in all ways we are making us for choice.
We're very excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help drive <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business or for people to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful <unk>
And the more they are careful in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East East Germany, if you had a typewriter that I had had to get to the government.
I had to register a piece of text that was written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of someone who could do this, the very much thing that we could do this, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer and print one page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes them own and on your printer.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems in the web.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to win a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are actually a lot of <unk> online, <unk> that would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and so on, etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online -- but they do it by illegal media by providing money to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought it on a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this tells me had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going out of a bad thing.
In the future, most of the crimes, online <unk>
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that the move, the protests, the protests, they motivate them to motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that they do it for protest and the last group are the national the United States and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
You know, the security of the site and perpetrated a <unk>
I asked the last week -- I asked a meeting with representatives of Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if he <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an Indian authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you serve the <unk>
Well, you need to do it if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we were going to have a foreign authority authority.
And that was inspired by <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the protesters <unk> the <unk> of the Egyptian secret in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
And those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a big <unk> communications <unk>
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The company <unk> is right here.
And so, Western governments provide the tools for <unk> governments to give them this to their citizens.
But Western governments do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by officials in the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected of a <unk> in a good criminal case that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The connection to the Internet.
So even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and to listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why would we care?
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in a game game.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we will have today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future administration we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the southern National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my father in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate into the park.
And predators, like the lions go, and this is what they do.
Show us our cattle.
This is one of the one who killed at night, and as soon as we raised in the morning and found it dead was very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
They are dying are warriors who protect our community and livestock and also are mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions they killed in Nairobi.
I think there's so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the won of his father and this was the same thing that I was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions gave them fear.
But I realized that actually this is not <unk> because it even helped the lions see the pen <unk>
I don't love me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick lions to believe that I was close to the <unk>
But lions are very smart --  they came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving around, it's always here.  So we jumped in animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come out.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with what to turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp of a broken <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and <unk> the electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights down.
As you can see, <unk> give out the outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how lions do when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> lions for them to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
And she had killed a lot of animals and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see it at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving very much.
And my idea is also used to be used now throughout Kenya, to scares other predators as Marcel <unk> and it's also being used for <unk> elephants as well.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship to a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So, a year ago, I was just a kid in drums of the savanna <unk> cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and a pilot when it grew up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and to lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture you how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric fence -- CA: A close <unk>
<unk> I know it's already invented electric fences -- but I want to make mine.
CA: You know, I would think of it before, and <unk> <unk> I have tried it before, but I got a little bit because I got a <unk>  CA: On the second one, Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to <unk> at every step that you have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on Earth.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would come all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Though sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all of my life in North Korea, until it all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public row.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister <unk>
That said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak and we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I cannot erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead, in the street, holding a kid <unk> in her arms looking at her face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
An enormous famine called North Korea in the middle of the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during hunger, and only a few survived they were eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequently <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights in the sea in China, just crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, right?
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation was sent to China to live with relatives family.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But I suddenly learned that it's not only extremely hard, but also dangerous, because the refugees North America were considered illegal immigrants in China as well.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be brought to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was <unk> at the police station.
Someone had accused me for being <unk> then I would have my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the <unk> he said to another, this was a fake report, she's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North America in China seeking asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were eventually <unk> were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape, a lot of other North Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
And even after learning a new language and to find work, all of the world can make it in a second.
This is why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to lead to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, and I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of <unk> years of <unk>
I even went through a global identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my pride with me.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea it was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the test of <unk> to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities made some money that sent my family, and as a punishment dies, my family was going to be displaced to the force in a place of far in the <unk>
They had to rush away immediately.
So I started planning to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to engage in a way, for over three miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and <unk> by a police officer.
He said, <unk> and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after going to the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all by releasing my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison in a short distance from South Korea.
I was going and came up with the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man thought, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and no <unk> the man was the ATM there, and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I read with all of my heart, and I asked her, "Why would you do?"
"I'm not <unk> he said.
I am helping to get to the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The nice unknown stranger will <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to do it when they were <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of unknown and the international community support is really the rays of the hope that the people who are building needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But they get their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English and social language and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in contact with family and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help for North Koreans an opportunity to thrive in international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores and fast food <unk>
And so the city planners get together and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South America to it represents something else, so they changed to Los Angeles -- as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles South Africa,  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like millions of other Americans, I live in a <unk> <unk> Los Angeles <unk> home of the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times as well, say, <unk> <unk> which is like 50 miles away.
And I would kind of see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home and see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see chairs <unk> and sold as a car cars.
I see centers of <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And then I got tired of them to drive 45 minutes from <unk> and back to buy a apple that doesn't have any <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by x 3 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided it worked.
So my group and I, L.A. Green. We get us together, and we started to plant our forest of food, <unk> trees -- you know, nine vegetables do.
What we do, we're kind of a kind of paid by ahead of the gardeners of all the <unk> of all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city came up with me and at <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my backyard, the <unk> became order.
And I said, "Go on, right?
A judicial court for planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, you know.
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's <unk> miles of <unk>
That's the equivalent of 20 <unk>
That is enough space for planting -- millions of <unk> plants.
Why on Earth do you not look like this?
<unk> a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars to result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you grow your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there. Tell my children there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, <unk> as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of this canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do if they let it be their canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the land.
They were trying to see how it affects kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, which came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night, and they were in my backyard, and they were very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad to be there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
And I felt shame to see people who was so close to me with hungry, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people are going to steal your <unk>
And I say, "My God, I don't have a fear that you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it -- but at his time, I want you to get your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a refuge in the center of Los Angeles.
They were all these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I was given his stories about how this was affected and how it used to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a couple of 50 people coming from, and they work and <unk> all in a voluntary plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if none of this will be told if you're not taught how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of them.
And I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see little guys in this way that are in this new way to them, that leads them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to get rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you can produce the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to wear container and turning them into <unk>
I didn't love it.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What sustainability about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor to grow their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take your <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me in a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  Probably everyone will agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains, a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we have.
And especially if you're going on the <unk> and these cars, it's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a <unk> highway <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can move through it, so all of the rainwater flow goes into the sides and you're going to have a road for which it's easy to drive, and you don't get water anymore.
Can you also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road on the surface of the surface <unk>
So first a stone, then and then a few more and more and more and more and more, and you know, you don't do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bumps with it.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be converted into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they will be going to be <unk> and you separate from the <unk>
So, if you drive the road, you will get the <unk> you saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material happen, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we use <unk> <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into little bits and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel and steel out.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can warmth, especially the steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones would move back to the surface.
I used to use a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big machine off here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to get to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So you test many samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> in which we had to do a lane for trying to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did aging for samples, we put a lot of payload on them, the ones then with our <unk> machine, and we knew it and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even they can even double the surface of the surface. It really will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about if it also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how repairability works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having <unk> one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to Jewish BBC in his little gray radio.
I had a great smile in his face which was unusual at those days, because the news is usually <unk>
<unk> freezes my father.
I didn't know what it was, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and they made girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was inspired as a child to <unk> my older sister who couldn't be alone outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, we take a different route so that no one could be suspicious of where they were.
We had to hide the books in a market bags for it to look like it was shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us had a few of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we knew our lives of life, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total of the remote province of a remote province in which his daughter, my mother was to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to convert our house to school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first one of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk in not to educate his kids.
Over the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated about our life and he was always scared and he didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father would say, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, to do it.
So you still want to not get <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the middle and if my family had been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He's not just about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, who carry it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador to <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, as the mine, <unk> for them, even though and even in front of an ideological opposition in <unk>
As <unk> it's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from <unk> to his village, and literally stopped being killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
And when you get to your home, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he still <unk> his daughter to school, they would get back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I didn't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've given my mind from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often successfully forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a parent who recognized the value of his daughter, and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under <unk> the girls who went to school they tell me -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that the Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would argue that these changes didn't last a lot, after the age of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> by them, that <unk> see a future <unk> and <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day of <unk> <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never come back.
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
One of the forces with a lot of other urban citizens within and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the edge, the fall of the regime are carrying out of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a copy of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 dead war, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> I left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the culture of moral <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, and I have dear, along with many other women, rebuild the civil society -- <unk> a ethnic transition and a national transition to democracy and national <unk>
There were roughly 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> roughly 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with an overwhelming enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about the development of capacity, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> <unk> <unk> to advocate for the social autonomy autonomy of women and our right to the right of our right participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than the <unk> policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, was <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day of <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador, and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up the news of the murder of murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the <unk> government, and its <unk> human rights <unk> and their lack of respect to the law.
Our society, made out of a revolutionary mindset -- and it gets away from ideals and early of freedom, dignity, social justice -- that we had at the beginning.
<unk> and revenge became the iconic of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today for <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm here today to argue that we, as a nation, we chose evil, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize right.
Because election didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men as for women?
Perhaps what was missing wasn't only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus on more than the election -- that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of female more than needing the performance representation and quantitative of it.
We need to stop acting as an expert and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but it also puts the mercy place rather than revenge, collaboration instead of competition, <unk> rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God.
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that spans all the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus takes completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all the existence.
So he goes, "My mercy is <unk> all the things."
And this is how you say, "My mercy is <unk> on my <unk>
They all get rid of the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a modern question, which has an equal response to you.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody makes a lot. Why does it be left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who <unk> him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, and a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old, just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> the American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> I would give it to the head with a <unk> with bullets from <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where they fall in every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I am a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at Harvard Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between those Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married to my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all across religions, all levels of income and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> relationships or a long duration or said in a different way, in families, the last place where we would want or hope to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse turns out so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be left with a man who hits him, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States women are about 16 and 24 years old -- have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence victims than other ages, and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
And I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold night in a cold night of January.
I was sitting next to the subway in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had had just taken from a university of the <unk> <unk> and he worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field of the field.
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most smart things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partner.
He did it especially at the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me -- who was list, he had gone to Harvard, who had gone to Harvard, who had been a passion to help girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why I was in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was going to go from New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your couple, so I would say, I quit my job and <unk> and I went back to Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was coming from head in a physical, financial <unk> and psychological psychological trial carefully ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where he was supposed to feel so safe it bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another <unk> kept the pillow under our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that he lived in a little.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I never had lifted my hand, my life was already serious for me every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I threw the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what happened, I was confident that we were living happy forever, because I loved him, and he wanted me to get a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a very scary sense for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
He had been a <unk> accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I had a few times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back to our moon and he ran through the traffic and threw a Big Mac in the face.
<unk> he went on, one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three women is a victim of domestic violence or cyberbullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control informs every year of 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why would I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man and was the only person in the world who could help <unk> face to the <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why didn't I get <unk> I could have been at any time.
To me this is the saddest and painful question that people do because us, because us, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the murders of domestic violence occur after the victim has been in end to the relationship, after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include bullying the permanent bullying -- even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family justice system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time with the man who would give their mother.
And we still ask why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of one last little <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody the world: the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family, and I am here today because all of you will tell me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like headlines, <unk> <unk> <unk>
The question, "Why are you <unk>
So for some people is a way to say "The fault is it by <unk> as if the victims of <unk> became <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've been hearing hundreds of stories of men and women who were also saying that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and to give them their lives joyful lives and happy like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a song of domestic domestic violence.
I became marrying a nice, cute man and we have those three children.
I have that black man and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to you is never a <unk> gun pointing to my head in hands of someone who says that I will.
At this point, they are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which silly <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting their daughter, her sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love breaking silence.
And I follow doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request.
Talk about what you've heard about here.
Stress thrives only in silence.
They have the power to wipe domestic violence just throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would take the abuse of the light to the light talking about it with their children, their job, their friends and family.
They put their vision of those survivors as fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the direct signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe output on it.
Together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like that.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but he will find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These orphans are very <unk> less than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while you cover your head.
All right.
Why did I do that?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable with the photographer and the photographer said to me that I was going to get my back and <unk> the child's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we could do to transform our looks, which, even though surface and <unk> has a big impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model.
Because I am a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how do you be a role model?
I always say, a <unk> was discovered, but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last few centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape and <unk> and a white skin.
And that is my legacy, heritage that I've known to leverage the money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that they <unk> Slow Up -- Joan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we need them to know as much as models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York, I told all of us and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, only <unk> is to say, less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know about that.
But later, what I would really tell each of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be President of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or an elderly surgeon ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first.
If after this monster list, I'm still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nowhere, and you could be the <unk> of American magazine or the CEO executive or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is how to say you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you take your studies, and you have a resume and a couple of jobs on your backs, no matter what you're going to do, is that if you have to be President of the United States, but you have your copy of laundry <unk> for 10 years, people would be weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, virtually all photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
And this was the first picture I was asked -- and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're going into the ground, but it was a little girl.
This was my grandmother with my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
These are <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of his <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can get this stuff.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is to do things for free?
I have too much <unk> heel. I never have to use, except the couple previous one, but the privilege that I get, I get in real life, and we don't like to talk to.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a shop and I forgot to get money, and they gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red <unk> and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege that I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for how no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year of the teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them -- it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I was <unk> and <unk>
When I research for this talk, I found out that about 53 percent of the girls in 13 in the United States they don't like their body, and that number rises to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer they hope is, if you're a little thinner and you have the most bright hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And then behind the cameras, we give a answer that maybe we could do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative, resourceful, passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my every day every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a set of models, because they have the best legs, the brightest hair, but probably are the physically <unk> women on the planet.
But especially it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender <unk> when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to keep out of this talk, I hope you're all more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was enough enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't know that I was <unk>
There was no medical directors, no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, even a very low health in lighting.
In fact, most of them took random tourists.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
He went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife was approaching me, why don't you get to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
Here's when we start to ask for the tourists.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and fortunately, nobody has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl, I could understand it.
These pictures are a lot more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way of stopping the time in October and making us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, not only the physical level, but in every way.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how to perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when he suddenly stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the dolls store that <unk> from small in previous visits of <unk>
And he described what it had felt like five years of standing at that same place.
<unk> that was reminded by the heart of <unk> with strength by the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York are universities because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we created are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many family pictures.
I am always the one that takes the picture.
And I want to encourage you all to show up in the photo, and you don't want to get close to someone and asked him, and you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, <unk> as characters -- stupid stupid characters.
More recently, if you have been following the press to say, <unk> applause and applause -- these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And they're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> in New World who are mostly at <unk> as the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the United World, where we have 16 species of <unk> at 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are they <unk> important, first of all, provide ecological ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all bacteria. They help all bacteria to absorb anthrax -- that they would not be due to themselves and caused great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take from three to four times in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the protective and maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the UN and below Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are very, very important <unk> in places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so that these will provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the verge of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey to the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned by using veterinarian in India and they've taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread from the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge <unk> for <unk> -- the number of cases of rage has increased greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them by half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Okay, we're investigating these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so it's going to focus on a locally trading problem.
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become active -- make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed his mind because he saw him fly without effort, no energy costs.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all of the stuff that I would have, the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with seeds that are south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the river <unk> and we taught the local growing tomatoes and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all who were at all who were going to come to work, and sometimes they were giving them to come to work, and sometimes they were not going to be --  We were amazed that the local in such fertile valley, they didn't have had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we couldn't find anything, we simply said, "Thank God that we're here."  You have to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato man would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe -- we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and eat everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, "My <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you have it? "You're never <unk>
I was thinking that only we had the Italians making mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what they were doing, the French did, and then seeing what they were doing, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>  -- <unk> to see the waste that you gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> Mormon missionaries and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
I am trying to make any of a different culture as if they were my children, I want you a lot."
<unk> I treat all of a different culture as if I was my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little bit is <unk> written by <unk> who said about the whole economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This would be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference was taking a cane on the floor, and he said, Can you imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided for the age of 27, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you'll never start anything, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
Never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We sat in a coffee -- we sat down in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, but not in <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings.
The entrepreneurs never -- and they're never going to say, at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they been <unk>
So planning has this blind question.
To the smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't take public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the health care doctor of the company, the doctor of the business of the business, which sets up with you at home, at the coffee table, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way to make a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city from Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this miraculous junk that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to me to see to ask: "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something really, really hard.
And so --  And so the government says, <unk> <unk> --  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before getting involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now we have reconstructing reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you with you.
You have to give you a fantastic offer to the <unk> and then you have to do it in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
So what do you have to do with you more of this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the fossil <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> it's not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
<unk> government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a remarkable story that in a futuristic magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year, he gathered this group of people, and we got this idea of what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not there in a hundred years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move into the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in <unk> so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in the United States in the United States of course <unk> generic generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very small, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a little bit about it.
Otherwise, they will never come to talk with you.
And then you have to give you a absolute absolute, <unk> <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell is that you have to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be done, selling and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the <unk> and observed to the 100 companies of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> all new companies, Google <unk>
There is only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
It would never be the word, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business <unk> in <unk> in bars along with their dedicated philanthropic environment who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> someone who ask you, "What does it?
What can you? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that <unk> <unk> who looks <unk>
We activate in communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so I don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for your <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes before the cow stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the wilderness giant <unk> which gave shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries ago, and I trust a city.
It always strikes the music.  There is a parade in New York City,  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures of the world, but also one with the largest number of <unk> properties.
I live close to this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this led to me a profound gratitude for the lived time.
He gave the significant things from my current life.
But I was able to keep this eyes in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to be able to catch up and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted about it to <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So, <unk> could make a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk> --  Before I died, I want to sit down on the line of <unk>
"Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people to <unk>
"Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live out of the <unk>
"Before he died, I want to <unk> once more."
"Before he died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
"Before he died, I want to be completely myself."
So this abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and dreams and hope of people were laughing at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
This is about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and new ways that it's <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of text messages that they wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in our civic center, we made a kit, and now have been walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed up the power of our public spaces, if we get the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever before, to find the ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is brief and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that are giving us more power.
And if you think about dying death, our life.
Our shared spaces, can reflect better what matters to us as individuals and as the community and with more media to share, fears and stories, the people around us are not only able to help improve places, can help us improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
We don't speak, but transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
They share it -- pass it happening.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and mind in this: has never been <unk>
When I sing of our childhood, trying to say the words I can't even know me -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel he's 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that every single songs came out of my iPod, conversations that we kept four years old, and I could pee on my arm for the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
Isn't that amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit the concept of <unk> of society, and they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what I pushed my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though that was the case -- it could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social media and learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual it manifests itself in a different way, where it would be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed -- a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that the fastest growing in the world, there is no cause or cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years ago when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smaller things, and I found the cars in a row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have a <unk>
As I grew up, it would become more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, a child who looked at the world without any biases, a human being never had.
<unk>
I can't deny that there's been some tough moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change for normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of them is wrong.
It only means that there's a different view of what is right.
If I could make it a single thing like <unk> and the Sam and to you, would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the ultimate <unk> of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the change dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what has been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me a teacher of communications, which gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big unknown words.
But when those conversations -- I felt what <unk> had felt like when the hole was the hole in the <unk> and he saw the door of a new world.
I just sat down when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are being attacking our greatest challenges, from energy to the environment and health care -- and if we don't know we don't know what the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as a scientist who didn't have to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are invited to see their whole world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
You don't tell us how you study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, carefully <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as I would <unk>
On the contrary, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise with ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies are ways to hook and engage with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget the signs of <unk>
You have asked why they call <unk>  What do the <unk> are <unk> <unk> kill, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supporting too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple word, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then to provide graphs that will bring our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it would be.
I think these are just some key that you can help the rest of us open the door and see the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all over the Oxford English director is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor <unk> from the 19th century that the defined much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who searches for a public charge of it, and they would think, and that when he wins, you get it for the grouper use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by the <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end he had a popular support in London I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most of you think it's literal <unk>
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to actually show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have been <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about quality.
And it was not even that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected an idea that you could have King for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everyone over the world got tired of <unk> because this debate was happening for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to become power.
They wouldn't call it if he was giving him to him or his blessing, ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was a <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was actually a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with such a ridiculous and girl, as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't know.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we're going to go out waiting for a few more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the title of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 <unk> nuclear heads of the world and a fleet of aerial air vehicles and so on.
reality and history have laced the title of <unk>
So the end won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness of then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the type of 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives had been going to be able to tell you that now it's the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I'd like to <unk>
Politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, actually changes much more the words that what that could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded and heat and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but most of all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and stones with the tools primitive.
As others, I carry a cheap light lamp, he supports the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> the branches of that hole in a meter straight hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
So my hand and suddenly I remember a mining that I met days earlier, who lost control and dropped <unk> feet on that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the deep part of that hole without paying a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew there was there in the world but not as much grade.
When we end up talking to me very sad, I was honestly about to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I got <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
A few of us even considered my second home.
But this time, we would hold the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced for all of the slave slaves for the whole slave man.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of some <unk> of <unk>
However, today, you can provide entire families for generation by generation for 18.
And amazingly, slavery creates profit from over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then find that they are forced to work with no threat in threat to violence and they can't escape.
The slavery is working on the <unk> the goods produced by slaves are value, but those of them produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet illegal is illegal in the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
They put together at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their heads, to 18 at time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> I would make it quite a lot of <unk>
They were the heat and the dust that my camera became too warm and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, like, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side very quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't give you a direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were all gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for his release, and he trusted her to <unk>
When I was waiting to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children dragging rocks for miles for <unk> <unk> to trucks that they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who load them and children <unk> their heads to their heads <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we affect something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing with what to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, they had completely burnt home.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was inspired by women who had been previously been <unk>
They drove me out of some stairs <unk> which gave this dirty basement of dim <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as he knows in the craft, they are local for <unk> prostitution for force.
They have small rooms -- private, where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of just seven years -- are forced to entertain the customers and to <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each place is dark and <unk> identified for a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse in their <unk>
On the <unk> I remember <unk> <unk> <unk> and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it must be caught in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no big windows in order to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because you touch a very hard subject, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic happens to us.
There are hundreds of people going on in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can go forward.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families running on the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait.
<unk> hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk on the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me about his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
You still hope, yet we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the world's largest artificial lake in the world.
When we come, I was going to get a quick look at it.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen in a boat, two older brothers, some younger children makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
<unk> branches out in the <unk> lake in Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear -- getting to water to release the branches.
A lot of people are <unk>
Since remember, it's always forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love, I love it not going to run away, and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to have younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from a day.
<unk> and <unk>
And I can point that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will be because of someone who decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners, the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to take it on a dirt road to the rainforest.
At the end of the way, we were able to get out of the car, and asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that I <unk> the path and after walking around an hour we found that the road was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as they put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> on the road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a massive mass of holes that could fit into a soccer camp, and they were all filled with migrant workers.
A lot of women had children strapped to their backs and, as they were looking for gold, they were able to save them in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under earth for 72 hours.
<unk> have up to 90 feet and these people carry together heavy bags of stone bags that then will be shipped to another area where the stone can extract the gold.
In the first sight, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to the edge -- we see the other less lucky men and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took it to work with him in mines.
When his uncle died their uncle, <unk> the uncle of the uncle who was a slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that physicians said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, that is compelled to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it is this kind of determination, from the face to a remote, which is why I'm inspired by respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted it to be testimony to them and that we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines are people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I'm going to happen that I don't think of these so many beautiful people I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force where you see them -- in people like you, and I hope that that force turns out a fire and that <unk> light on slavery is because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I'm doing mathematical math -- and there's a peculiar problem for whom we are like management consultants are.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  -- that we will see later on.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high-level level of dexterity and probably some kind of <unk> that you can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> which, in his day, it was a virtuous ballet ballet ballet ballet dancing.
In the last few years, a lot of progress has been done in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if actually there is a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's very frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement has no biological <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic doing it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials are never done.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test they could do ourselves?
I didn't need a personal thing.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
And so what I want to do with you as well as a try, you know, you can see, in a certain sense at least we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone with a healthy person while it emits sounds to speak. Can we imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the <unk> genes for example.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary training.
Consider the time he takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as it <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects affects the <unk> also affect the <unk> organs.
On the plots you can see an example of irregular <unk> of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
So both of these are <unk> OK, but in addition to the test tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are low cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something happens to be so <unk> it appears on a massive scale.
These are some amazing lists for <unk>
We can reduce the patient difficulties in the patients.
They wouldn't need to go to the clinic for comfort.
<unk> monitoring we could get goals of goals.
We could make it massive <unk> for a clinical trial for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that respect, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk> Initiative.
<unk> and <unk> we want to take a lot of voices across the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local local lines for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or no Parkinson's, can I call at low price and <unk> and I'm happy to announce that we've already achieved six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you. 
What do you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yes, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. Yeah.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> you might not know it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the savings factors for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a precision accuracy at this point?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to have a fantastic work -- has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the cellular cellular network, as well, what we would take the project, now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: Go and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March before March 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> <unk> creatures.
We were attached to the darkness, in the dark, no windows and, by the large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin that we can even more perfect -- we can do the impossible and we can focus on the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with a lot of years, and a true taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
A few time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was <unk> <unk> there.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by wave.
The water level has reached over 24 feet of height and over three miles on land.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
It would take the rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We removed tons and tons of fish dead, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we love it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors were similar things.
They found photos and <unk> photos and cameras and cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and push them to different places of people around for <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save his lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up the stall, gigantic toilets, <unk>
This place turned out to be the place in the village where the <unk> center <unk> the photos.
And there were the honor and I had the honor that that day would be done in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years ago, they were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with much precision and <unk>
On the other way, that little girl would have no aspect of it, and that would be so tragic as I had the photo.
At the time of the time, they got the more photos and they needed more <unk> so it was that I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people in 12 countries volunteered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people who had raised <unk>
In Japan, in July, we're going to get to <unk> a neighbor neighbor to North <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the time libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we were able to get in <unk> is a different story, of course of the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be a <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw a virtually hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures long in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae -- with algae -- and even oil, all of it with the time I continue to <unk> it was a very important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless he was clean, dry and been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a guide to a neighbor of <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos even more <unk>
As I said once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought these pictures were kind of relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her but stopped when he figured out that he would get them even more.
I also had a <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would never have been, we were able to get the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When he collected his photos they shared some of his history with us.
A colleagues in her husband found the photos in a fire station between the rubble of a lot where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, their husband was the fathers to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
His young children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
I took a week to find his whole family and knowing that they had survived.
The day I gave him his photographs under 14 years.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could see -- something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that was not labeled at that day in March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up -- hundreds of them, the great <unk> -- the great majority came back in the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families hundreds of photos and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We take photos all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would have to look for.
This was the project of restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone to the connection to the past.
When a picture like this gets back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger to return something, using their talent to something that are not being thin to perfect skin.
And I would like to finish this email. I would like to read this electronic email that I came back after six months.
While I was going, I couldn't help but think of the people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photograph with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, and I was given a picture of my family -- my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, and my newborn daughter stood out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on one of a millionth of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames a second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new very fast technique that can create videos on the slow light of light.
And so with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they defy the camera idea.
So if I take a laser pointer and turn it into a <unk> and it is in a number of a second or a number of <unk> to create a <unk> pack.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common.
So if we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> into this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of the light in <unk>
Now, all this --  -- remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't make this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, start <unk>
Some of the light is going to be <unk> and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves are moving down the table, and because of the <unk> of the bottle, you see it in the bottle, after several boxes, that the some <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a marine <unk> and we make it going down the same distance and we see it in a slow motion of about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us sitting to see that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow bullet in motion.
And what about <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, the tomato wall and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, and I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes can see a full composition of it.
But if you look at more and more like this, you'll realize that, as the light comes <unk> from tomato <unk> it's not <unk>
Why? Because the tomato Revolution is <unk> and the light bounces inside and it goes back after several <unk> of second.
In the future, when this <unk> is on your phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at India?
As photographers, you know, if we took a photo to <unk> it comes very little light in.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest display -- so I could hardly get some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, <unk> into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good temporal resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also even the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to where distance.
When I projecting a laser, you can record a photo in languages, which you see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we are going to try to analyze the multiple light bulbs.
Can we look at it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going back on the curve again.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected through the open windows there.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new consumer sector in order to fix the problems of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself was a scientist, converted science to art, an art of photographs ...
I realized that all the data points that we collect every time is not just for scientific visualization, but that we can see.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves -- remember, time between each one of those waves is just about <unk> of a second.
But here is a lot of fun.
If you look at waves under the <unk> these are going away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, would have loved to see this image.
The order that the events occur in the world is sometimes invested in the camera.
<unk> the absolute warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.

I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people <unk> in search of a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that you can find out for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who from sending your mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
flow.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission filed the E.U.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every single Internet provider has to store a wide range of people from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company, or their <unk>
And across Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention to data.
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers, all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, but everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out on the streets of Berlin, and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of you even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest phone company in Germany, which please would give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to you and I didn't get a concrete answer, and it was all blah.
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to take a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end of the end, he agreed.
They demand for the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly bit of brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 percent of information.
I looked at the beginning, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life on this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk>
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to be <unk> on the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
One, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we're talking a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they're called between them.
And then one calls the other, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate to each other, what time they call each other to what time they sleep.
You can see all of this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to who, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a mobile phone in my pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Berlin would never have happened.
And as a result, not every single <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store so much information about us as it can be in and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to <unk> forever.
But <unk> and live in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not just <unk>
When you go home, you get to your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask his phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to tell them to remind them that they have to fight the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, for that <unk> all the time.

It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It's just by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to ask you, I'm not a source of inspiration.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, they want to be disabled.
Come on <unk>
<unk> at Christmas, are in the shopping center, drive in circles for a parking lot and what do you see?
16 places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P.

I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would be.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you help him <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my first three older sisters -- I was <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents -- the school system -- to the school system that I was too on, and if we didn't take all of the maximum note all of the top of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years by putting my feet on their feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me for me to do it.
The <unk> that I carry in was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking around as a <unk> champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there's 20 Arab and continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
The people who grew up there had trouble with my faith.
But it seemed to be a lot of a lot that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so I think of the dawn at dusk is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy for that sent me to the dance school.
I learned to <unk> whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to <unk> me too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer summer on the coast of Jersey, I would not go.
I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were getting into <unk>
On the summer holiday my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and I was reminded of the Dead Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the cure cure was her yoga.
I must say it's really boring, but before I do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents had this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of state of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet of the theater.
They all love me.
I made all the tasks of least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my classes, and also in his classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of the zoo of the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> "In the end of the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I am a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department crying -- historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the stunt stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunt stunts -- you can't do the <unk>
It was a piece of paper that literally had been born and gave it to an actor without cerebral <unk>
<unk> was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disabled papers.
When I stood up, I went home, and my first tour of <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't look at me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that New York City <unk> didn't make <unk> actors, who was not white, with disability.
You just give perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I did <unk>
In my first tour <unk> he took comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first note that led when I was at high speed on the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say that I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little nasty rumor that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival from New York City, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind you to <unk> to <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of the stigma stigma <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to talk to the cable TV program, and this is Keith <unk>
And I went to a graduate dance, I went to a study, and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I grabbed up to the security desk in order to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't get me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like the <unk> of a full time <unk>
Something fun that I learned in <unk> Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
They are said that children are <unk> but they would never be <unk> of me not even larger.
Suddenly, my disability in the Internet became <unk>
And you know, video clips online with comments like, "Why would you do?"
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We should actually pray for it.
A reviewer suggested even that I would add my disability, to my <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair cannot make <unk> then <unk> you can't do someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the world's largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
Doctors said they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media, I don't think I would believe it.
I hope together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images that would be less hate the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we even need a whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I came up with a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the Syrian refugee children, a small part of what my parents were given.
It was the only time my father saw me -- and I was doing this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
She lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
The drought drives the little people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no work, or any of the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you get about a guy who offered him to <unk> after dinner, and <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, who gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money for you to buy new clothes, money to send home, your family.
They present a young lady.
They finally got home.
It begins a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb.
That little kid in that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how does the story of a little kid in a little town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start the future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> urban urban urban <unk> riots in London, <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the great promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for the opportunity, of well-being, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
Often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of <unk>
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't afford to opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of towns 2.0.
And in my hometown, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit <unk> Hospital.
I remember going to be in the hospital to <unk> thinking, thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some youth leaders at a corporate ball.
They were going to be 90 juvenile leaders who were <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, I was a graduate graduate student, <unk> frustrated, I was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to point to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point at some time to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does it do about this story differently?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think that the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so often.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was able to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed arrived, if he wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from overseas.
If you give somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of us who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a <unk> and design company <unk>
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> which he said, could he survive the hard climate <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for marriages, by creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working in the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
They want to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and as he says, sniff out the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, but their story, it actually had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at her city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to engage them in development and set up in their business.
They ask young people with the resources that they need, and they support the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and will create an <unk> to urban growth.
For me, the spirit spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park, of <unk> this is how it is called, when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: I will have young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace <unk> which <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in the middle of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going to be on the way that we could hardly pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with seen to a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible <unk>
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> <unk> and old <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
<unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought was going to clean up his <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how a <unk> or where they were going, who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, to the reason for 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> product every day.
I wanted to know you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who I do that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and I walked through their pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I need to get a further further into more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And he operated the mechanical scans and drawings and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe believe -- and in the days that it's very strong one is going to be rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot of getting used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> to the weight of bringing over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of the FBI <unk> the collection collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You are coming out and moving into traffic all day and pass around around you.
You just want to <unk> so usually the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also garbage is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentless <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a breathing or breathing way.
You must always be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective way every day, this starts to break away from its container and their dangers in the very real way.
Perhaps we had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we have no space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing out your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed that we need.
And so I mean by just the speed of what used to move in the <unk> time.
We don't have any of us <unk> or <unk> or we took our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, we forgot about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that it would take to it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about garbage collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to make ours.
It's almost a relief.
The flow that they keep it leaves us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I listened to the <unk> of a collection collection of waste on the street, I grabbed my little little baby off the street, and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did, all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her for doing that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that I began to investigate waste collection and went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together, and we made good friends.
I want to believe I was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and to account for all the costs -- even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The city waste that we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable meeting.
So in the flow of your day and their lives, the next thing you see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
I would give you a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life being part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a commercial center of a number of floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Addis Ababa,
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to leave you <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second of all, you need a lot of energy because the reality of the <unk> creates heat in it, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it is a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, it looks like nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a case for a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually completed with the old market that is this structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building, by applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to survey the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the image, didn't exist yet.
And it's also among two parallel streets that don't communicate in a range of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing that we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries from the building.
And this spreads into an <unk> atrium, that creates a space in the building that would spread through its own shape of the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with little businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that led to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of <unk> <unk> to allow the input to the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons.
They have properties of fractal geometry and it helped me model it.
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This would be shown with these little color crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
So with these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center -- it wasn't what we did.
But at all, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center because in the end of the commercial center because it was more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the power of energy to the building in a city where electricity was almost over.
So we managed to get a big advantage by putting up in the ceiling.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which together collect water for the <unk>
You wait for the early early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not to only understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the <unk> a structure of a thousand years old, which was surrounded by a wall with 12 doors of access with almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets and creating 12 initial blocks in the size and the characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of these strategic dots in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell of the project as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best guidance for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we would make a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It's got these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density in the upper levels and a smaller density in the floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving to the community the space that was occupied by construction.
It's where all neighbors, you can get up and <unk> and make activities, like running a <unk> race, in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect the nature with the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was so strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after my school <unk> I was a little late and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt came into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's teacher grades.
And then I did.
I would take ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few Like this.
And all the sounds like --  And I organized my book to the <unk> but to see, some of my fellow colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes of the world, without any imagination.
I put them to all rows of <unk> and myself a row of a way -- just because of being there, because I will <unk>
I'm still shocked by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I was very important.
I don't understand why I never got <unk>
It's that everything was obvious <unk>
I would never be surprised.
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason why I was annoyed that this little little girl was so good for <unk>
I <unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies are suffering from jealousy.
The birds also are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that will die of loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab where you study them in all of their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know whether it's exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, I would have had the literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school school, because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers to everything, and when the jealousy, almost all has all of them.
This year has been 100 years of their <unk> "In search of the <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of course, all we could have.  And we think about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a kid trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in you.
We forgot how hard this image is.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what is the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, which is reduced to the person, to desire, their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being the kind of storytellers and <unk> we know exactly what details -- <unk> the knife -- right?
<unk> make us all amateur <unk> and that is something that I was able to understand.
All she does to get pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to tell yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every <unk> cool that <unk> detects in his lover, it adds to its collection of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are they <unk>
The <unk> of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the language of <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of jealousy, you suddenly hear behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're really scientific science <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> are search of knowledge, to search of the truth, an incredibly painful truth -- in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>
He says, "A woman who makes us experience causes us to experience it causes to us a lot of more profound feelings and vital that a wise man who can tell us about it.
Are we telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> will reveal us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at such <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited for a very <unk> young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something strange about that man, that he didn't lie in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking at things that his wife did her wife without realizing it.
<unk> <unk> or do not accidentally get stuck with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels described very well how to <unk> it makes us <unk> but without accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become the residents of fantasy.
And because of this reason, I think, <unk> are bringing us to make violent acts of illegal and illegal acts.
<unk> they drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for the age of eight, I'm going to get it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years old was captured by having created a false account for Facebook that would send horrible <unk> messages for a year.
For a year. A year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former former boyfriend.
Because, let's be realistic.
What's a huge thing, although creativity, creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who deal with how jealousy, confused our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, it can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to get to you for your self and <unk> from what you would ever have, and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your cow bank your blood accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as sometimes wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
That is, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
novels show us <unk> I'm not secure.
So we're going to do what characters always do when you're not sure, when you're in a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street <unk> and asked by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the curse in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief head of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
"Oh, I sound so <unk>
<unk> it needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of six <unk> once they <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history, and I think this is very emotional -- this scene is mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute, they're the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> can be <unk> that idea of being <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, it only is a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get the excellence of the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction to <unk>
Just the fiction <unk> the jealousy.
The fiction used to <unk> it to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the module on Apollo 11 and landed on the Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were themselves, but their presence on the gray gray level, it was the culmination of a collective process <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest rise in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA took about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
And including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, which he wandered after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why did we find?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> 50 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our ordinary home.
Why does it matter? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words in the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. Some ask, why is the <unk>
Why do we turn our goal?
And they could also ask, why is it scaling the mountain <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why will fly over the <unk>
Why does Rice play <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West over the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the significance of the powers of technology.
They were because it was really great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technological atom.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the crew crew 10 10 miles / hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo Apollo 10, and the optimism is about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve like going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world's population seem to have a result of it.
I remember looking at the <unk> of the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube <unk> that rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what it came up with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists had found us <unk> and we had enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an inclusive explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have created fewer <unk> companies that are <unk> from the years to <unk> Intel -- Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It mostly goes wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred short investment minute than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest in technologies in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital of the development of the development and that development is in the long term.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars it would take a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't fix the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from sources of renewables like sunlight, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to be able to have alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now technologists, technologists, and economists are according to what policies and foreign treaties were able to develop the development of a <unk> energy -- a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in today's political climate that we will see an energy policy or the international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technology, result is not to be.
We know from time long that famines are a result of the failure of food <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can do things like crops or the systems for the storage and way of food, but there will be famines while there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes make a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon President was telling him the war in 1971, we 1971, but we found that there are many types of cancer -- some highly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we cannot solve problems with technology.
We can have and we need and we need -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to be able to fix the problem, the institutions must be able to support <unk> must really be a problem with the <unk> and we need to understand it.
The mission is that it has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves those bill.
But it's a model that is in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no popular science <unk> like exploring solar system.
In general, to go to the moon it turned out to be straightforward.
I was just three days.
And really, I was not even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first is a <unk> there's been a great decrease of trust, is a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turn to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and that could have raised in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can go to <unk> polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that the trust has decreased.
When you look at the views of opinion over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to have the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> the judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway through the way.
But is that enough?
What research polls are, of course, opinion.
What else can they do?
What you see are the attitudes <unk> that people manifests themselves when people are asked for some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
probably <unk> by asking, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very bad answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
Which is so rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel like a certain kind of <unk> officer or type of person, it's going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary school that I know to give for the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my closest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have these evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we left side to all that knowledge when we think about confidence in a more <unk> way.
I think surveys, are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they are trying to have the good inherent judgment in the fact of trust or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
I think it's a stupid goal.
This is not the goal that I would <unk>
I tend to have more confidence in what is <unk> to trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust in what's not reliable.
And I think those people who are taking their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, well, I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> intelligence, that's the right target.
One time you say, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
This is about making a judgment on how good people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They are <unk> They are <unk>
And if you find that a person is <unk> in the commodities -- and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worth trust.
But if, in the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends that are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends that are really sure that you can do certain things, but I see it <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends that are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is like this, I still haven't been surprised.
But that's what we're looking at is what we are doing before trust.
The trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all kinds of professionals, professionals, officials and others, that made us make it easier to judge their reliability.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem it takes more time to make <unk> <unk> that will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we will argue that the <unk> system that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we would call the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know a similar examples.
Let's get all of that, by the target.
I think the goal is supposed to be more <unk> and that things would be different if we need to be worthy of trust and <unk> people who are reliable and whether other people are trusted or political members are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task of reconstructing the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they are two people, together, trying to make trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's defining because <unk> other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all people, all the time.
But you also have to be worthy evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That goes on every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> institutions -- very well.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks is that I can help me without giving us explanations.
I take it and give me money, or it makes me change for the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson at that.
If you get vulnerable to the other side, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very difficult to <unk>
What people trust are in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worth trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers of computers we've become <unk> by reducing separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen in which imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been progressively becoming more and more and more and more and more and more and more than one millimeter, a glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes back into the digital space, so that when the hard force gets into the screen transfers its physical body to the pixel again.
Designers can make their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool they break barriers.
But two hands stay still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of hands?
In the Computer Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital digital field.
And they would take a sound transparent <unk> to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, getting into the three-dimensional space, and grab pixels directly with the hands.
As windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and <unk> <unk> or words with the virtual tactile sensor that you have below every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
So in these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we reverse the papers and make the digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and turning things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device into your head or <unk> when the system knows the geometry of your body.
So if we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it physicists so that we can be able to <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this single physical truck.
This magnet magnet, it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And in programming the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and <unk> and stay in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and <unk> and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality as they want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike <unk> or the textbook -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something that will begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to address our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that remains our imagination.
Thank you.
I stood up to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to break a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they create strongly that there was only one way to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether the job would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer Chinese.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to an opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult will tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
My friends were <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew I was too much more to train.
My dream will never happen.
I think that during the rest of my life is a second kind of happiness.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
Nobody else wanted to <unk> OK.
<unk> to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I got to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were from China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda a convenience. It was <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange as well.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap. and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave me a place of reading <unk>
We would have a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map, this map seemed to me to be out of place because this is what students in China should learn it.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to research camps as a comparative literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if art was working for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and political and <unk>
By Buddha are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of missing in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel I alone or powerless before.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that achievement is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where the passion, where happiness.
Until a <unk> <unk> can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always are <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman, <unk> <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> stumbled 2: he threw up on the couch of my office and told me that he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could drive it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move the head while I was making the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work after that, you get home, and it has children later, to death later.
As Alex as Alex and I had time to <unk>
But a little bit later, my squad <unk> <unk> to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the Alex <unk> of Alex being a pause in its development.
This made the Alex <unk> of Alex the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, this kind of <unk> benign problem, it was a real problem, not only for Alex and loving life but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million educated <unk> today.
This means about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think no one comes to age without going to go before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yes. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream -- a <unk> I want to see. All the parents matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend 35 years old.
This means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and moments of <unk> that makes it form for your life to have been when you have 30 and <unk>
People from over 40, no training <unk>
This audience is going to be well, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner in 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and it's <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change of themselves, now is the time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the moment to break it up on their body and their options.
When we think about development, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its daily and common life has a <unk> impact on the person who are <unk>
But what we don't listen to is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical time in the developing development.
But this is not what the girls are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the time of <unk>
Researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence <unk>
<unk> gave them <unk> names as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
They said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It doesn't happen anything.
They stole that person to the sense of urgency and his ambition and it does absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart, smart, interesting people like you or your children come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't own. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "You don't have a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better curriculum.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point about the 30, it crashed the music and they all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was going to be standing, so sometimes I think I was married with my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the educated here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit of it, but you don't know the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure, so many of you start a career, to pick up a city, pick a city, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's some research that starts to show -- which is a lot more difficult and stressful <unk> to do everything from once to the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying a red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
Notice that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you are sitting in the room, and they're sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What were you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the kids are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or a entertainment, but I couldn't still decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I was living in a very difficult, very difficult, old life that had been even more difficult.
They were frequently often in our <unk> but then they would get herself to say, "You don't choose your family, but he can choose their friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning, and I had spent a lot of contacts, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if you give me <unk>
At that moment, I had a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like I was just sitting while the 1970s.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or women, deserves to know.
First of all, I told him that I was getting away from that identity of identity and <unk> capital of identity.
For capital capital -- I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: I capital of identity capital creates capital of identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not have to count, by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that exploits jobs and doing it.
Second, I told her that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are excellent to get you to get to you at the airport, but the educated people who come together with friends with the similar minds are limited to who you know what you think about, how do you think about, how do they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out almost always comes out of the outside of its inner circle.
The new stuff comes from what they're called weak ties friends of your friends.
Yes, half of the educated have a bad job or they don't have any work.
But the other half doesn't -- and the weak links are the shape of the way that we would take this group.
The middle of the work has never been <unk> then to meet the chief of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published it.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but they do their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but because she was growing up, Emma will soon join her family, when they have a partner and form their own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit down than 20 or even the 25th and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now, or <unk> now when all on Facebook start to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and it involves being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill a time with whoever you do to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fourth quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped get a job there.
That offer gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with the living thing.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special <unk>
This married man who chose a <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter to say, "Now Africa's contacts spaces are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The girls are like airplanes that go out from Los Angeles, who come out at some of the West <unk>
Just before the <unk> a light peaks makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, to the 21 or the 25 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good time, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years, or even on the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the educated you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity capital -- use your weak rituals, pick your family.
Don't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27, I left a very <unk> work in management management management at a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and testing.
I give them tasks.
When the work would go back to grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had better performance would have no test scores <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a substantial perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the way we measure it differently.
Is it <unk> but what happens if you have successful school in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I quit the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West Academy.
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> on military training and who is <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children would <unk> as far as possible in the competition.
We studied political professors working in the very hard neighborhoods, and they were able to understand what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
So we teamed up with private companies, asking yourself, what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, we came up with a feature as a important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is a passion and <unk> to reach very long term.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to their future, day after day, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my resolve <unk> and then I waited for more than a year to see who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination -- they had significantly better determination to <unk> even when they were <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the tests, even the safety of the <unk> they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or at the <unk> National <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for the children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know how little science knows about how to development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How could the determination of kids?
What should I do to teach kids a very solid ethic of work?
How do we keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are simply not following with their <unk>
In fact, in our data -- the commonly determination is not related or even related to the Stone Age.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at University of Stanford by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they fail, because they don't believe that it would be a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where to finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start all again with the lessons of <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan, like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
And over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that whoever wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new new method of learning Chinese could be helpful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every one of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese Indian <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy people.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- long enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> understanding the basic idea of web pages or the newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as well as possible to be <unk>
They get a mouths.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was screaming <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This is actually <unk> in the form of the called, but I like to believe that it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
And the symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that you create more characters.
A person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> like this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
This is a meadow like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a board under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two sides. It's very hot.
Three hundred together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon, bright together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a chart inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming up hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three of them together, hold care is <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you're going to be able to learn a couple hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that a Chinese learns a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters -- we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth of the Sun.
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to origin, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, <unk> has turned out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down from the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be about being my dad is the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the employee of Oz together.
The movie was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to use a bright dress and bringing a magic wand off.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raised our children in a kind of industrial complex of child fantasy shows now.
However, the magician, the Oz was an event itself.
It doesn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with this evening with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl in the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about? <unk> Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the Oz magician, do today, the magician, say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the armies were very <unk> of evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing of the magician magician, is that the <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I saw "Star <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I had a son as well.
Just three years.
He was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the length of surveillance had <unk>  And so slid in the room and he was impressed by a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what it was?
They would be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke took one military to <unk> government?
I was going to do this with the <unk> Oz of <unk>
How do you make the movie?
In doing good <unk> with all and a <unk>
This is the kind of world that I want my children to grow up, OK?
Why is there so much capital force in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this stimulus.
I know for experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first sentence really hoped that the credits would start to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why do you stand there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and defend the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though they, children, are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job when you're teaching girls how to defend their <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have a few great women who write new stories for our children, and real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to be appearing in classic <unk> in classic <unk> or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until a lot of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out.
I recommend all of you, it's available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good -- not let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies is the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not completely <unk> and they are already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book and in the <unk> in the '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there's more of a female character who has lines?
So there's the <unk>
These women are talking to each other at some point in the movie?
Their talks are about something more than the kid as well as <unk>   Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women exist and talk about things together.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I very rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right?
<unk> is not the proof of <unk>
And I don't think I would argue, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the big moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door, say, <unk> bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular films, how many of them believe they have actors who are <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percent that the number of women we've chosen for us recently for Congress.
But there's a bigger number than this one who is going to take care of this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, right?
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with it.
Nor do I think music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a great amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What don't they achieve with it?
They are <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to beat <unk> with violence, then charging the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are scratching that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want <unk>
We have tools that are tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that would happen, but I have to ask, "Let's see it, if at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of manhood is changing better.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star character, <unk> Do you know what he meant.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that they know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want you to be less stories that I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where he looked at her work is to join a team, perhaps a team that was led by women, to help other people better and better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would get to <unk>
I started to see forms and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I can see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to a almost 1.3 miles away with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and do a map of the past, I knew it had to do in a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use this <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern lake in Egypt called <unk>
And you see, in the naked eye, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we're able to do it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink bright.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape of the <unk> and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find a <unk> old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great revival of old art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile Nile right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
Trying to find it at random would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, that we thought it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians doing <unk> they can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it in ice, but instead of the climate change, we look for the human occupation of human <unk>
Five meters down, below a thick <unk> <unk> layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> of a number of years that date from the Roman Empire exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones in the front of the Roman Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that comes back from the Roman Empire in this place.
We also have the evidence of a jewelry jewelry shop which shows that what was there, it was a very important city.
We don't find any <unk> here, but we would get to the place in a close future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train people in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform a lot of discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire which was probably written in <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really began in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from high time.
It certainly puts the <unk> for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the front door, home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now I would take a group of <unk> obese in bicycles.
They are competing with a race and <unk> and they go into their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide with the door of your home.
There are bikes -- flying around all the place, wheels that go on their side, lightning of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, the line.
In the lobby, or what there's the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that he talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> letting it tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you go to a little bit about getting into the mouths.
They go through one side and enter his living room.
In the room, and making use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on your center center, singing <unk> I <unk> One <unk>
Now I shake the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> way from the oven, come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, waiting, suppose, that this would be like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, looking at them just once.
<unk> the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
A hundred whole poems is just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be known of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England to have one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have average memory.
Everyone involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using old techniques invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize the addresses, and that <unk> academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "How do I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful <unk> English and brilliant English -- and he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can get me to me.
I mean, you have to start by <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year I don't only train my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is very likely to have the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that he had a problem with <unk> it's impressive.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that lets you see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> at him based on the <unk> <unk> <unk> film <unk>
We went on one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City -- <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on back, I read a lot of treaties on the memory written something over 2,000 years in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time where this idea of having <unk> and disciplined and <unk> was not such a thing as rare as it looks like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but we also have changed.
They have changed the <unk> and I would argue that they have changed <unk>
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last place on our planet where you are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined and <unk> memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> of the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers from University College College invited a memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, structural <unk> or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
Once there was a really interesting difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI scanner, you put your brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of <unk> found that in the memory champions of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they would be <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in competitive competitive tournament is running as a arms career, where every year is someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors must be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards -- <unk> that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and that he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
Within a half hour. Yeah.
And while there's a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of a concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following: I tell two people who remember the same word -- I tell you to you -- that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, "Is there a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which is <unk>
The person who has been told that his name is Baker -- unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capability. That is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It doesn't have any relationship.
All the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> <unk>
They were okay when they come home to work.
You probably get some <unk>
And when you were looking at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this on a half thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired him like entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't bring it to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up on foot, <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and as soon it was, the classroom of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting there.
And so you couldn't afford to <unk> them.
A tragedy behind the other.
I was standing outside, a single survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting next to me.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> pick up at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember or <unk> or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual visual and exceptional spatial memory.
So if you tell you that I would give you the first 10 words of history that I just told you about -- it's very likely to be very difficult for them to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell you who was sitting on the horse speaker in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory reader in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, the same way that I would have done it -- if you were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some absolutely ridiculous image and crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then it comes in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for the word, that will be confused but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek, which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people were thinking about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase was <unk> it would be like the first place in your memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got out of it with it.
I went to some of these memory skills and had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting at <unk> <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I have no access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school license bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was some fun <unk>
I would never expect it to happen.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is better and better and more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some <unk> <unk> covered with tape, because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put it in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment went out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course it's cute being able to memorize speeches and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be building <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from some <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We were able to focus on when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, it's not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing species, a kind of complete attention that most of you are not being supported by there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
This is how things become <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I'm going to do, that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me -- which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to us -- we are going to be so <unk> that we won't even be able to process in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are capacities for amazing memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we can only get a place -- New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> which I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' house, in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was an balcony he gave the living room.
And there you all spent the time watching television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I was <unk> and I was going to put it up in a towel all of me.
And I was like this.
It was bad, insecure and hated it.
I had that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture architecture, because architecture is not about math, and it's not about <unk> but of those synaptic connections.
And it's not surprising that we feel like this, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the ceiling.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this one, I know what you think about, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it by based on a building built thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We use 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and the governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know that they're going to work.
So we found it with buildings like this.
It's a beautiful <unk>
This is the Public Public Library of <unk> which was done in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, he has a <unk> he has this round thing round and columns, the red brick and they leave <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of ownership -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the architects that are constantly producing new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life ways.
We gave we <unk> and we gave them a lot of people that are completely removed from the people.
All of black, this is -- you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to those symbols of <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are happy, but we feel like <unk> so we start experimenting with the pendulum behind it, and over and over and over again, we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was about the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
It's really very hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give it <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we converted them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> they won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time at commercial centers, we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic fantasies ourselves.
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian or Italian.
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They are easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we visualize memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know that this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experience with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques of design, and we found ourselves with new <unk> in some ways that will be <unk> against other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum grabbed back in the opposite direction.
But then something else happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> academics and public, were completely aware of a building.
New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao raised in a half percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and he was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and <unk> and how it is possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The world's major mayors in the world.
So they all thought if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of new millennials happened with other Islamic architects.
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few of these elite architects at the threshold of new millennium, actually began to move through all of architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
You think, for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have to walk up to the next village to see a building.
<unk> can be <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now; that means that the speed of communications has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is going so fast, too.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings again, before you know if the one who designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
And for 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much people are.
That is never going to happen <unk> because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, and it's going to be on both extremes of <unk> and effectively <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> in emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, the building, was part of the community, and because the drawings looked at exactly the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, and that first summer, when people began to get and they share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and in charge of these symbols, us we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think of a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building built today, first <unk> the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with innovation <unk> about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there's no unique answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and drawings and complicated, and you are no longer a <unk> audience that you don't have seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop being supported by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one way to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find proper solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical <unk> historical brick in ideas that must be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings will be <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking shop in Miami in Miami Beach, Florida, it also can serve to make sports or for <unk> or even one can marry in the night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars in the connected community around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion, so <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
No matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
Architects are already familiar with how to make buildings more and more friendly buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not in the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the way to the most <unk> spaces, the local libraries where we formed our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it very great -- typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
He <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to be thinking, when do we couple of doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at the Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it has 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be misunderstood and <unk>
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's kind of confused because even though his mom tells him all the time he was beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Among what your mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow colleagues say, don't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to leave a <unk> "I'm beautiful or <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager, which gets these answers on one of their most vulnerable lives emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenagers trying to communicate in this way.
But what are they doing this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, in a continuous way -- so young.
As a mother said, "It is like a party in his room all <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that they go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, is attached to our children to <unk> based on the number of things that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what's not.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is rigged digitally.
What is the highlight of someone in front of someone in front of what is normal in a day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of imagery.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is a routine.
And trends like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to see what the young people are.
But kids are also not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars in sports, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all of this?
Well, surely we want our children to grow to grow and they're good individuals.
But in a <unk> culture, we are teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities and their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls would prefer to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how to move to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They are going to participate in the classroom arguments, because they don't want to call attention to their physical stuff.
One of five are not taking class at all the days when you don't feel comfortable on it.
And in the course of testing, if you don't think you are good enough -- specifically if you don't think you are thin, thin, <unk> a smaller note to the average of your fellow who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it turns out irrespective of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be well clear, we're talking about how you see you -- not how you are really.
<unk> about your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> teenagers are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more dieting don't healthy that they can lead to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around the world, and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this for what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol -- and drugs, diets <unk> aesthetics, sex and sex and no protection and harm.
The pursuit of the perfect body is <unk> to the health system and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
Their percent of women are not presented with a job interview on a day where they don't feel safe in the way that you can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that try?
<unk> this potential is about interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first is that we have to instill in your own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, you know, the situation.
So we must make sure that the program follow our children is not only going to have a positive impact -- but also <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused in six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are kind of key <unk> for anyone who would be willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is a fundamental education, but facing this problem requires each of us to take charge into the issue and be a better model to keep women in our lives and the girls in our own lives.
I defy the current status of how women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not a good thing to tell with the contribution of our <unk> politicians or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can begin by doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can make people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you. When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow up to to grow up all of their individuals, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who really are making the difference in a <unk>
It's going to make a difference in the real world, let's make them be those who come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they can be seen to be the ones that they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who is in mind?
Your <unk>
Your <unk>
Your <unk>
Your <unk> A <unk>
Could it be the woman who is at two car seats a distance. What would it mean for her if it was liberated from that <unk> voice, in his interior, he would tell him not to have long legs, <unk> <unk> a more flat <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would make this way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the imagery is getting rid of all of us.
But let our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
<unk> to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change every one of us, the way we're talking about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age today, becoming agents of insurance change in the same morning.
Let's do it.
The five November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the CEO of the League <unk> League <unk>
They initially were initially innocent. But being prisoner by other minor charges in company others, started planning attacks to about 12 New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans would be <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be treated.
Later on, they would be convicted of your participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was an American engineer with a loving mother, a <unk> <unk> teacher teacher school.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam -- that very few, even most Muslims are getting to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to interact with the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all religion, there's always a small fraction of people who are going to be able to <unk> their convictions that they think we need to use all the possible means that everyone lived as well.
A few months before arrest him, he sat with me and explained that in the weekends, he and a few friends, had been going to break in Long Island, to practice.
He said I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I played my father <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he <unk> gave him a little orange light on the target and to surprise all of all, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle became the other and Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
At all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they seemed so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people were later likely to be convicted of putting up with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the North Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times -- that instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone was a time of packing and getting another town.
As I was always the new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
It was secret -- my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, to be able to put it under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
They have an opera -- it was <unk> by the basis of people, based on <unk> indicators like your race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I started to test my thinking, was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in juvenile violence, because I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids that we had done, was a Jewish night.
I took a number of days out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend of mine, and frankly I felt very proud to beat the barrier that all of life had been made to me believe that he was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job, in Bush -- a park in <unk>
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and fewer critical that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people like the way I would have to wish to be treated.
So that feeling was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of the interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what is going to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest with my <unk> and he helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with character.
In many ways he became my <unk> <unk> at a moment that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was trying to think, and she told me something that conserving in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
And at that moment I realized how much negative energy is required to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and started a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put me at a possible risk?
Well, it's easy.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day who is trying to bring violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way to understand that there is a better path, that even though I was attached to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't come to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight against terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of the terror, and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of the terrorism victims, against those meaningless acts, as rejection of my dad.
So with this simplicity here as proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
At this point there is a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an amazing film <unk>
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound that you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like a little bit of your childhood that we project to your eyes.
And he's constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the film are you who experiences all live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a real inner movie, you and you.
There is nothing to make it more directly.
So I know I have a good awareness.
I don't have certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just robots that we were getting to produce without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate your consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
science, for nature, it's objective of it.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, we would recognize that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> behavior, the neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
It was a lot like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to break down the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of great work that I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work in neuroscience is answering some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy trouble with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real <unk> mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a movie internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give them a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The classic <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms, all of these are questions about how the target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk, how we talk, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why everything is accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, is actually still not much to say.
I'm a scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would beat the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness at pure terms of physical terms.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
And I think we are getting away at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful, wonderful explanations -- we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology, explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific worldview in the world.
I think consciousness right now, it's kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, he's got one.
Her crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what we need to do, is to explain the functions of <unk> behaviors of the brain, and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Young physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as bricks and the space and the mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties aren't in terms of the most basic thing.
On the contrary, they look at principles, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of how fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> <unk> that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental <unk> space, time mass, mass, Newton's laws, and then I applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, mass, then for logic -- you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> your consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it is suddenly not the object of science.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is we need to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness with other fundamental concepts the space, the time, the mass, physical processes.
<unk> physicists are sometimes saying that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can take them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is aware, not only humans, the mice, the flies -- even the microbes to Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or to be smart.
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you say, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, it's not.
But the thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling to <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think something that <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental stuff.
If it's fundamental to the space, the time and the dough is natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws of finding the thinking with the physical process -- is to have the information with information.
Whenever there is information processing, to be <unk>
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, a human awareness.
<unk> from simple, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with a scientific methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And I'm supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an amazing degree of information, <unk> a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a degree of integration of information, just as significant degree of consciousness -- very significant awareness.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, particles -- the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level integration of information is smaller and but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
It actually takes a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Furthermore, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind us.
As it explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be able to, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists are basically described the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire at the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences that can be quite serious.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I had nothing to have consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot hungry.
I think by thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact that consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an complicated information processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are doing some pretty serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective our planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group integrated as the audience in a TED Talk, and we have a collective collective consciousness for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer at the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing than the second, that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many questions, like, how many bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way towards serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're finally going to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we only need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile -- a very normal profile of education.
I went to school, and I stood up with my friends, I was fascinated with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get a prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, I was good at school, and I had a low profile on the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered if we take the disability outside of the equation.
A thousand years later, I was in the second part of the teaching of a <unk> school of <unk> just after 20 minutes in the 11 o'clock class, a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What did you do?"
Well, I had been talking to you about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about things <unk> at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people as an inspirational objects.
And we are not. And it's not about the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire them.
And in fact, I'm on this stage, I think what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to do that. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've been being lied to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you a fantastic way.
It's not something bad and it doesn't make you fantastic <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or is this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You might have seen one, from the girl with no hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the porn porn term -- because I would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we're going to be disabled in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worst.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost account for the number of times that I've been doing strange <unk> saying that you think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my job had a public profile.
It was as if I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images, those images are linked to people with disabled people without disability.
They're there for you to be able to see them and think that things aren't as bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
We would have a few things.
But the things that we need, are not the things you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was inspired by the so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled, because of society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
And the things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of their ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair to do it in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> saying it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have been sold to be this lie that disability makes us exceptional to us.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
And I'm here <unk> and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not going to be inspired by something.
And actually, I know that I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
Yet, I don't know that I'm lucky that it is.
<unk> this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how you can carry your mobile phone battery in the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance to others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we would embrace and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that has been sold to us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's a lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a stretch of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.    <unk> on a TV screen will not make the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to actually live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people who have disabled that we would be able to stand up in bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of individuals with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at the 11 grade school is not a little bit surprised that their new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think is that you know what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to do augmented reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because augmented reality will change our lives as well as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to <unk>
The first step, is what I carry your Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
I will allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you have to do with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the game camp -- the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man from 110 pounds of <unk> trying to <unk> it with all of them.
I've been there and I assure you it's not quite nice.
So I would show you some videos to show you what the Google is using the Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you a sense of it.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of the <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine rising to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment -- a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of these, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more than feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be your favorite players, and you have asked at YouTube and in <unk> <unk> can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that.
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you know.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap enough.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Oh, Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What is going to be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before he run and do a <unk> which will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I could be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball into the bottom of the network?  Or they would be doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> <unk>
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, it will happen.
How do we get to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> reality when <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick refresher on the technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his <unk> of the field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed in the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They got more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player going to your group and you see your next move you shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have to <unk> you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
And to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they are missing parties, and they hate <unk>
If you lose games as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your play <unk>
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a look at the top of the people that's below.
You also get information from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> something that you're already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
You'll have the bad information <unk>
So this would be the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being in order to nerds.
It will be also for <unk> Who would have been <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that you're the field <unk>
I would get the ball and <unk>
<unk> to an open receptor -- suddenly a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you are going to kill you, you don't know it, but the system of <unk> <unk>
They went to the protection area.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there's an open receptor.
Do you get the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land. But the receptor sees it in its bombsight an area of grass that lights and can change the career.
<unk> <unk> takes the <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion.
So I'm going to make lots of people look, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
Do you want your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of the reality of <unk>
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings to show to someone what is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But what's worth this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology worth this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it also worth a <unk> or an Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, as usual.
Thank you.
I was fascinated by 23 years of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the southern tip of the <unk> County <unk> which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to it that's called its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural style and its architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The bridge Golden Gate was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer started to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from the openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that traveling between the two towers will bring it to another dimension, this bridge has been shown as such, so that each of them will get you out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a four to five seconds, the body strikes the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which we contain vital organs.
Most of them died in the impact.
The ones that not, they usually spread out in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that the ones that are <unk> this suicide method will realize <unk> death to the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people have been before they had their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its immediate moment, it's very difficult to bring you back.
I took this photo last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had this day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We were able to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were killing suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new public.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at July 22 earlier last year to receive a call from a potential suicide bomber sitting near the center.
<unk> and when I arrived, he looked at Jason talking to an officer of the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason was about 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown over here two times before New Jersey to try to kill him from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked you if we knew the story of the box <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and every kind of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind and a smart guy in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see how she was.
The fathers of Jason had the <unk>
<unk> damage affect a lot of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What would you do?
What does that mean?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
So one way to ask you the question is, let's think about it in similar circumstances have thought about ending life -- you've had these <unk>
They get to the person in front of you can save the life and the inflection point for them.
Other signs to despair, despair, believe that things are terrible and that you're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do to <unk> social isolation and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on the 19 in January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he's with her permission and <unk> I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope that you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but I see more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> of the 49 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as it disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and reported that the car car was down in the bridge.
I had seen it jumped from the bridge to the <unk> in the evening of the day.
Thank you very much for caring for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong before without having a real mental <unk>
It shouldn't be that easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the path that his son took that day, and also the value to get out of it.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied a radio call by a potential suicide bomber on the sidewalk near the north north.
I climbed my bike. He looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for her that day to go back on that lane and give the life another chance.
When Kevin did, he turned him out.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that he made <unk> and gave him hope and the other life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I am <unk>
They stopped me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have this letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th of September 11, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was asking for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness which has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as the saying.
We thank God for you.
I didn't teach you in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited the General St. General at the San Francisco at the end of San Francisco that night, you're going to be <unk> as the patient.
I knew I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a family member of society.
It speaks about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather would stand up with poison.
That act, even though I finished his own pain, I was theft of the opportunity to meet him.
This is what the suicide.
For most people who are looking at or those who consider suicide, you wouldn't think about someone else.
They simply want your own chest pain.
And usually this is being achieved by three things: sleep or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and called suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved involved in only I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
So during that time, I was holding my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave aside the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that all and every one of us must be able to work to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There is hope. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world causes you to be what you don't are, but you know what you are, and a question asks you how you focus on it?
I must be a single thing in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model -- I felt that I was finally able to have a dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> my real inner self with me.
So for complicated reasons, that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning.
We all love our families, our religion, our religion, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is mine.
They recorded me like <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt in the head.
And my mom was going, "Why don't you wear that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never loved sharing my story, not because I think that being a bad thing, but how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mama, my dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a goddess goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if I was <unk> This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when he was still wearing man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why don't you have been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was <unk> she was responsible for the expense of <unk> and he owned, and that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> between over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was of queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they were <unk> remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and I told me that they passed my application for the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was shocked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen queen,
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you ask the America to change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to put my name.
She was also hanging out in Thailand to 19 years old.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
And then in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity has meant to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this <unk> woman, <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who lived was living his truth, but that <unk> put her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we make a <unk> of <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living in living and just me.
I want to do the best to help people live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for one day no more <unk> from 20 <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> first, thank you very much.
My support network, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young people who have been <unk> and sometimes when I was called, and they told me that his parents couldn't embrace it, and he took my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it works, it's just not. It's just an identity of gender, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned to a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that some times that homework doesn't block -- and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. All right. <unk>
In many <unk> and tribal societies, to the parents generally are known for their children, but I'm one of the few fathers who are known to him for his daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by education defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the <unk> the <unk> <unk> of peace, became very popular in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we had a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the inequality, of inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, right from the very beginning, when when I was born a girl, his birth was not <unk>
It's not welcome or for his father, not for their mother.
Next neighborhood comes back to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother becomes a lot of a young girl.
When it comes to the first girl, the first daughter, the first daughter, gets sad.
When you give birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only suffering, but the daughter. The newborn daughter when it grows, he's suffering as well.
At age five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home, and the school admits of their siblings.
Until age 12 years old, it has a good life.
It can be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it gets 13 years old, you have to make it out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and her brothers and her family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that of course honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this kind of honor code doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of the male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies.
This is supposed to be a very good girl, very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that it accepts the decisions of his father and her mother and the decisions of the elderly -- even if you don't want it.
If you get it with a man who doesn't like whether or if I read it with an old man -- she has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be a <unk> of <unk>
If the very young man, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
What about the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter, and the same lesson for his children.
And this vicious cycle goes and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't love enough to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And a lot before I was thinking, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was married, everybody was men, and I grabbed my pen, <unk> a line of my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half years ago -- in my school.
So you might ask, why should I tell your homework of a girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
<unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspiration where they can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be able to go to the school, and they would be able to go to a couple of weeks earlier, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on his personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've put all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education to <unk>
To my daughters, I taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of people in all of our and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At 10 years, <unk> got up and stood up in the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog she was offered her myself for the New York Times, and he spoke at every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and <unk> nine of 2012, was fired at <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he told my wife -- "I must be grateful for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't give you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These very few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back again.
When <unk> was in the hospital, and I had severe severe pain, because his facial nerve was cut out, I used to see a dark shadow that was blown away by the face of my wife.
But my daughter would never be <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get fine. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, is like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't get his homework.
It's fight with her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People say, "What is there special to me in my tutoring tutoring that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, I don't ask what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut your wing and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion to me.
I'm a engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
Are you still like smart or not?
Is it not going to be like that, you can <unk>
After the <unk> was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what much to take, from more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mixtures of chemicals, and try to get them to stay alive.
I have been saved by little.
But thankfully, I have soul soul, so I decided that I was going to be able to try to get the wrong dose, because it really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with different mixes -- and I was shocked to see how small changes in the dose, dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I was five standard chemicals for a twentieth man, and I was amazed at how I would address my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I was thinking all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've known several types of guys like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem that had in front of it, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave a new appreciation of men and about what they have to <unk> I have to get better with men.
What I tried to do is <unk> those hormones and <unk> and so forth, it was regain my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking -- my <unk> of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my key reference point to how to do those mental imagery that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes can see things like <unk>
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery is fundamental to the thought and <unk> thinking.
So after many years, after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> actually <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use your imagination only to lead to the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that people can be creative can share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by the top of them in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image of functional MRI, to represent the brain, here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual by the same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the content of the central column on the left.
This is repeated in many different individuals with a lot of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to make brain waves in the visual field of visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while <unk> their brains to create a large pool of brain reactions to the video sequences.
Then you showed them a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as it would be <unk> new <unk>
The computer using just the scanning brain information -- and I'll show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us <unk>
We're pretty close to doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This led with the <unk> brain systems that are available today, and their resolution was a thousand times over the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I didn't give you that one.
A lot of people are proposing new projection techniques from images, even me. <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger, but at this point, <unk> magnets only offered small improvements in the resolution -- not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than bigger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can make structures much more complex and slightly more different -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI went to make really big, right?
However, most advances in recent advances in <unk> and brilliant solutions in neural solutions and <unk> in the radios and frequency radio frequency in the MRI machine.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field, it can <unk> magnetic patterns in the frequencies of <unk> radio frequencies.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of scanning radio frequencies, we can increase in massive information that you can extract in one <unk>
And then we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid -- but the one of the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity is sleep.
We're going to be able to put our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options than opening this door.
But anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it'll take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
His closet is probably saying to some person for the first time that the loves or say to someone who's pregnant, or say to someone who has cancer, or any other conversation hard conversation that you have to do in life.
And so all of it works is a hard conversation and even though our topics can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have gone out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the <unk> <unk> <unk> I didn't have my armpits -- cite the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope that by the <unk> of my short pants and I would have got my head on a little bit, I would ask myself, usually a kid would say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear as well as the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and we get it into it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready -- and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  He had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I had to <unk>
And so I took deep down and I went down and I went down and on my backs a little girl, and I was four years old, which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I took a deep breath, again, I stood up with me about it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something troubling.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I looked at clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to wear a dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
I am a little bit of a kind of girl from a <unk>
And that little girl looked at me paying attention, and he said, "My favorite friend is <unk> and he's got a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was complete just "Oh, OK. You are a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some cabinets in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why it comes out of my closet was more difficult than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> which is difficult is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared banking bank, it's harder than saying it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is more difficult than saying to your age of five years that you're going to <unk>
There is no more difficult, it only exists the hard.
We need to stop to give it to what is difficult for us to make it difficult for someone to make us feel better or worse in relation to our cabinets and we need to only feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they may make them feel security, or at least more security than you offer the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
He was not <unk> lesbian to fight for any child in four years to go into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, he slept in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay nose, and the moving only one is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, strangers who I've spent my entire life trying not to <unk> and now the world would turn back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't launch that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was at the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that he was gay, and when I do my Lady of lady in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends were my parents, people who knew me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV experience?
Our favorite program, Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but hopefully I'm desperately showing his support to get me to know that he was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk> shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for somebody, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to <unk>
It's like the hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask any of you who have been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of high <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl at the coffee had no armor, but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other people need to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk>
If you know that you're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You can communicate your truth.
It would never be supported by that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> for what they've done, but I'm never comfortable for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that stuff in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very free, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen -- productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical of the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's get a step.
First, we start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth and the Earth not from the Earth's intelligence and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any idea about the intelligence of the Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, at some point in time, the asteroids that we would take on the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we will understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately modeled for development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states, universal states that we would use the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in planning planning has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of the robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, I said, from a number of years, there's a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It's acting to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices -- with the diversity of possible accessible, Yes, up to an imminent time, <unk>
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options open.
And so, looking at this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How crazy is it?
Do you face the level of human intelligence.
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research has suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that <unk> connection between the entropy and intelligence is a more inclusive relationship.
What happens if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system where you find it within.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple tests of animal intelligence, play with human games, and even make the money <unk> <unk> all of it without it being used to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a foot of standing without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for humanoid robotics and human delivery technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, like some other animals can cooperate pulling away from extreme extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can actually perform a model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here is successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> your potential for play.
Here we see <unk> new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps in the very successful web net.
This same <unk> capacity also has applications in health care and energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering it successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend in the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transport.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability to risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of smart cognitive behaviors such as use tools, walking and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all flows from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back at the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work there was always the concept that if we were going to make smart machines, there would be a substantial rebellion in it.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the idea of <unk> rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the other way, that the urge to take control of all future future is a fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out of taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important implication is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals get together, from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence -- is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a inflection point in human history, something between stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, for the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the light intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that you go.
The data gathered by Kepler is showing the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
And together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that gets their suns.
At its time, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of worlds potentially our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hotter recorded.
<unk> ice and sea ice that have been with us for us for millennia now, they're now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes we have caused at a global scale and we were very quickly reduced.
But I'm not the weather of the weather or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newborn planet, and the planets that we know better than -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor to Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world that was shown by a mission as the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and it's partly why we study Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that are <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies are now offering not only short space flights but also <unk> <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images we're going to remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the Earth's areas of our planet that still have <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places that the air is fresh and full of oxygen, by our rainforests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement is about the colonization of Mars and other planets I'm going to drag it up and the belief and the belief in some that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable the Earth.
So for a lot that I like to do the exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reason to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for humanity, is as a imagine that the captain of the Titanic is going to tell us that the party is going to have place later on the <unk> --   Thank you.
But the goals for the exploration of <unk> and the preservation of the world is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's only one more close to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and global areas of the ground, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'm going to leave you with a <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, Enrico Fermi said, <unk> in mind that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations are becoming advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we would develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization of us will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration and <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to adapt to the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right off.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early in Europe in the next morning, and <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was very well stopped.
I'm a neurologist, of profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rhythm, <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could do, systems that could be able to put in place, which would be able to put bad things out.
Or at least if bad things happen, you know, the chance that it's a total catastrophe that will happen.
So I started to think about that, but until one month later, my thoughts don't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked about the window, and she had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared shared with me who had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you can look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things to work or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, we would get a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish are, where you think of the trees -- you know, where the friends and friends live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism to find things.
But it's really good for things that you don't move very good for things that they move very much.
This is the reason for you to lose keys and read and <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for keys, a hook with the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer for her.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
So if you take a place and they're <unk> with it all the way you will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the mobile cards a picture of your credit cards, passport, <unk> <unk> to email yourself so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can make it easier for you.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So a part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful beings that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be loved to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is happening as a <unk> for all of the decision-making of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take for a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack on the heart disease.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you probably heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question you should do then, a statistic that you must ask for the most physicians don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or having surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor would not tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's somebody else's fault.
We have not very well understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help somebody help someone else?
300.
This is according to research from the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
So I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or a brain attack or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why don't you know, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things -- <unk> <unk> muscle chest pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> is not very likely to happen to me -- still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
You remember under stress you don't think clearly.
So you think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has paid five percent of 300 have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that helps you help your medicine.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is a part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
And you may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that it's more done in the age of 50 than 50 percent of the prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So 49 surgeries for a person who has been <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helpless or erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue before the conversation is going forward.
You don't have to make this on the act.
And you also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a great choice sometimes you want a shorter life in pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the <unk> of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you shut a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predatory face, you don't need the immune system or <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react quickly. You could get the lunch seat so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is rational thought like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to focus on the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to fail in a while.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize the harm, or to prevent things bad in the first place.
<unk> at night in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the gate gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I didn't <unk> and lots of text messages that I've never read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see organization like a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands of <unk> can be -- I would never get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system of signs, <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over in the decade in 1800, and with the time of time, he mixed up with local signs, and the language that we now know as <unk>
So, he has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a world of sounds, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk>
So how do I understand sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I have learned by example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating sure you're not <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for the sound, the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> to move on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic board there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Am I going to get more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it tactile or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me about the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and care that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the <unk> social currency, <unk>
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> was a kind of a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if they didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like and become my voice.
That way I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and the institutions and work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel like I could be able to do it at <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note is not able to capture and completely express in the paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the signals as well as the sounds of sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor of the piano, so that you understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different parameters
If a <unk> is a different <unk> for every finger while you play the piano, as the facial expression, the motion of facial expression, the speed, the shape of the hand and so, while it hits the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if it comes to just one key at time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in a long way to express a very clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the chord that would create a completely different meaning, completely different.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> sign on that."
This is the <unk> sign on that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and fold it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you're wearing.
This is all day."
If you look at it, and you shake the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said about <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how distance the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands -- the present one gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So, the first example is a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one who is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of the hands are high.
We are now going to do it both in your head and something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second I'd like to show you is this -- please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one. Please flip back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
And look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest -- but they're actually very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have the sounds, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> I don't have to hear it to learn music.
<unk> is a treasure trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you get it, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a ignorance bubble I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
And when I got older, I found out that the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good for cleaning others.
The time is, now I'm an adult and invention in the elementary school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge spaces.
So with my students, six to 15 years old, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our little classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> and so that kids are very happy to get in.
And I will say, children who manipulate electrical tools are really cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to engage them in something that we hope to work.
So we decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children are going to get a lot of the robots.
Then we create quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we end up before <unk>
And it turns out the light bulb and the web cameras on accessories and you put it on a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and for the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I would take this one step into a website for inventors called the <unk> with the hope that someone else would give it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to solve it immediately.
I can investigate my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get <unk> with this image:
A child, perhaps shorter than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> rainforest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and oil is also brown and the oil is <unk> and it is very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> which can push through all kinds of things that produce <unk> different <unk> which can help to identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, perhaps to tackle a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and probably remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started a lot of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> shredded several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear plant to the water.
And today, according to the reports -- an average of 300 metric tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the entire Pacific has traces of pollution by <unk>
If you go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the most part, it has looks safe is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and research on other scientists, the ground, the river, and we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all of his life.
And with them we discussed the data and we discussed that day, and we talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data in the <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust went down from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition the nearest to the date.
We get up to a half miles of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting sediments from the ocean floor with a chip of sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple source technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so much a little bit, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we become the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with metal, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical lens, you can basically build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of age, transforming their standard wheelchair chairs into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen scientists, creators -- we have to make the next generation to get care of the environment and the people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one silk silk cycle.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One <unk> over the environment, the other thought he believed.
One is designed by nature, another one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the raw, he looked at a figure that struggle to be free.
<unk> was a tool by Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we carry all the information required by every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated the world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of different parts of different functions.
But you don't find any <unk> material in the wild.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with microscopic <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One is only acting mostly as a filter, and it's mostly like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of every designer and an architect in working at the time between the <unk> and the organism, between assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and synthesis, it shows at two screens after me.
My work, at the most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and getting to the growth.
I'm probably asking you now, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they have four disciplines that offered to access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created it.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, and <unk> structures like this robotic arm with a scale of 24 meters of scale, like this robotic arm that will someday print <unk> buildings and graphics at the nanoscale made made of genetically altered buildings that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is from unique size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion footage with <unk> they're going <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
<unk> with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and <unk> <unk> and there's no seams between the cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combined and rigid and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution analytical and to the <unk> instruments that allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair.
The Carter teacher -- my collaborator came back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties -- which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies not through the addition of other material or other <unk> but <unk> continually and <unk> material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them got stuck and got to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sends on the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> tree.
For that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
All the tree was <unk>
Instead, the land was growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design be if the objects were made of a single piece?
Do you get a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material that we would have the kind of material of the <unk> tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> the most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced by disease as shrimp, or crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think if we can tune in your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>   We had a bunch of <unk> of <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
We have chemical concentrations that have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
So to print the large-scale structures that was built with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and create these structures made of a single three material long, 100 percent recyclable <unk>
When the pieces are ready -- you dry it off to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing <unk>
The air bubbles that were a <unk> of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which showed up on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria engineered to capture rapidly out of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> problems to mesh, and if it transaction even further.
A <unk> tree, <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for objects designed for <unk> in the sea, and putting it on the ground, they'll help you grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain life for the journeys of <unk>
So to do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> board, we made our own table, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological functionalities within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these vacant <unk>
In our first piece of laundry are <unk> two <unk>
The first is the <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the freshwater <unk>
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One becomes sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact with nature.
In fact, it never happens.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that comes out of tract <unk> that will help you to get these bacteria and to make their way to make their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material in the functionality of it.
If we wanted more <unk> I would get more transparent channels to it.
This digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another, it looks at 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football game, and 10 times more than our very small intestine.
And here is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures.
What if design would get the other <unk>
What if we could create structures that increases by alive?
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the fabric and destroy our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this a material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer printing material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture a home inside which is <unk>
The manufacturing <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It's done by combining not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers between each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first becomes the environment, creates a cocoon of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, are in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, attach a little magnet on the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, by putting the worm worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they would take a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different across different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, <unk> the <unk> structure was being transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates can shape raw silk without boiling a <unk>
They were <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk <unk> and we put it in our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> to the darker and <unk> and so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and the heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat through silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared for us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much shorter as we are.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
<unk> biological silk on <unk> silk is giving all this pavilion into the integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a design inspired by nature inspired by the design, which demands for us, for the first time, that we make in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can <unk> with your fingers.
Five. Three. Three.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never respond to the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had a <unk>
In school, I liked the English English, and the art and the art and the arts and websites played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And generally I like to try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and power in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to give it off.
But then I would tell you about something else, something totally different, and I was amazed at it, and I'm going to be <unk> and I have found <unk> I have found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it off.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing to deny all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me as a lot of <unk> was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me for me not to be able to do it at all.
I was worried about having commitment, or to be dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised me then.
They ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where they did it, they learned from culture.
We ask first "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about that age.
It's considered a naive matter of causing cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as we get in a variety of different forms, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what sleep takes us.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream of what might be, it's not inspired by dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it's going to do the other thing, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, although bad adults are probably <unk> and say, "Oh, that's cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk> -- and he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of who was converted into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The <unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something that is going to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What happens if there are many different themes that wake up with curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feel something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
Is it a <unk> so I say.
It could help if you divide in three parts: potential and <unk>
You can also be able to use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance age of the Renaissance -- the ideal was the one who was well <unk> in many disciplines.
Barbara Carson refers to us as <unk>
<unk> whatever term you like it or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields, and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, to start <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
A <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of its unique idea of his mixing of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
From there coming new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower -- is a rapid learning.
When we <unk> it <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of the skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all that we've learned to each new area that <unk> so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
As a kid pianist had an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known thing.
Before it turned into a writer, I was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started out, and this skill helps to write compelling the editors of editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to go to what you would say, even if at the end of the end of it will happen.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that one could not have <unk>
The third superpower -- <unk> is adaptability. This is -- which is, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes a director of videos, other web pages who sometimes died of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes it would find James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take various <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs and the ones that are really <unk>
<unk> of ideas and quickly learning about three abilities where <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a lot of interest in encouraging people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have creative thinkers and we need creative thinkers to cope with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
Just knowing the belly because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams came up with a doctor and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive deep and put ideas in practice, and the <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design life and racing to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part will be told that they're just more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with your inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> for all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those that you just saw is one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow its curiosity by those <unk> <unk>
They beat intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year, a woman named <unk> brought her to a psychiatric man in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If we had been alive today, we couldn't give it more help than he was born, gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for the <unk> and much more.
But a little bit of progress in treating Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think of this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the chance of getting Alzheimer's to be almost one of two.
In other words, there is the probability that your years is going to get in Alzheimer's years or helping care of a friend or want with Alzheimer's disease.
In America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spending on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs of five times in the year 2050, of course, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been made relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be solved or even even slow their development.
We understand less of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's in spite of the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is because of a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people knows, but the whole world, Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the last few years, all of the scientists, get Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only looking at a picture of a healthy old brain compared to one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's means significantly increase of life and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know today that are made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule, like a piece of paper it folds as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots -- they get out of the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can be large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we can do it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part has reduced cables and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> and hardware, engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. We're testing a new type of drugs that will block this is to stop this disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened to the test of these drugs in <unk>
These are the baby worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms -- on the other hand, they have protein molecules that stick into each other as humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to get that hope, to overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to warn ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease, and that if we can tell, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have been <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to progress in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk to themselves.
And their families, the hidden hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
They were talking about them and help for them to help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the New York Times column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone to do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience when you try it to try it a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will be able to get over 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number two: When was the last time you get to someone else?
And <unk>
<unk> that these are getting more personal and more personal.
Number two: <unk> really scares your partner to your partner what you like to do, or it is, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really detail really struck me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was a <unk> about this process of making love, but but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
But I had a lot of us, and I thought it was a good story, so I thought it was a good story, so I was sending it to Love Love a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking -- they follow even more?
And the reason I think you challenge this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the issue.
One week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I'd been working on an romantic book in the last few years, so I had invited me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can reach a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually only about my Facebook friends, and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would have probably some thousands of views.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was posted on line at night, and already on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had already called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article was over eight million <unk> and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence writing with them honestly, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of an international life has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, was first the question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick pursuit in the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages turned out immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
But I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international paper, you should expect people to feel comfortable ask about it.
But I wasn't ready for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published an article in St. <unk> which included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both made a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> orders for us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons <unk> from the <unk> process -- a range for which I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know only if it was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce <unk> love not only an adventure, but real love -- love <unk>
But this was a question that I was not able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you put it together or not, and they are in addition to <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these very much less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at <unk> <unk> among college students, using what they did, called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds Romantic right?
But the study did work.
The participants were more close to doing -- Several later studies, they also used to use <unk> protocol as a rapid way of creating trust, and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and community -- and they have used it between people of <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this piece, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a very small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
And I was like, you want to say that you have to tell you about the person who you have to do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better known after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and it was going through a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first true love of it, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I took back to science.
I was able to do all that I could find on the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could some form <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I was just going to research for the book I was writing -- but in retrospect, it really looks really <unk>
I thought that if I approached the knowledge of romantic love, I never had to feel as bad as I used to feel as bad as I was then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what it is.
But I can also see me more clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably being able to demand me.
What I look for love is an assurance -- not just being <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but that I'm going to keep being mistaken for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because fall in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also a scary story.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that says, still follows together?
And the content with a answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we ask more difficult, questions like, How do you decide who your love is and who doesn't?
How would you stay in love when things are going to happen, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to the relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a better conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's to be a year ago, a known year, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing that remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my journal <unk> love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when reading it now, not because it isn't true, but because at the moment, I had no considered anything that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't think a few times we would have to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing when he always wanted me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded in my questions, and I have chosen to love someone that is so generous, kind of fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the U.S.
But what I've done, instead is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't believe really.
And what I learned, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to do the happy implicit ending in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian <unk> and in a way, I became like a forest <unk>
New York City makes a while.  One thing that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with it when I was eight years old.
And I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar bill a dollar, a <unk> and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be, ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all of those <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and made a kind of a <unk> -- to the style Agnes Martin, the resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of it, somehow it seemed to increase from size, as if it was that they were making the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time I started adding electronic elements, we started adding electronic elements, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow through drawing just like a dead <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals <unk>
First of all, you have to get an idea.
Then I made insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the <unk>
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I became interested in human beings, sculptures of natural size <unk> with drawings of natural beings in layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was shocked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
And I started drawing in the glass, which was similar to drawing on a window window, and then another window, and he had all these windows together forming a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was very big, I call <unk>
To the <unk> he inspired me as much as "The lawn of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five feet long.
It's got a little bit of a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the <unk> to this <unk> of <unk> <unk> where they were <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a God strapped on a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the bin <unk> Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and spitting out oil in one hand while the other hand gets clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be a <unk> to keep the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a look at the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and spitting out these <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail turn to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go up, you know.
Her tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made of 1986.
They've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards for the terrorists.
It's very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and stuff or magazine or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of the human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They are like cells, they come together, they're <unk>
And you can walk between them. She's getting years old.
Each is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds of a human trapped inside it.
This is a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's his chest, you can get it into the entrance to it.
I'm going to get you through the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of his chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, it has a kind of thing that's <unk>
It's a quick refresher for these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see them.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's a little bit of pills coming out and enter the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
They take the box and all the people inside it strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you're <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we came to realize that we are all together, that this illusion that we are different -- these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill actually has an effect against pain, first of all, by the stomach, the guts and other organs.
I'm going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug would impact your body.
The <unk> however, is that the <unk> any drug gets paid.
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take <unk> drugs, these are actually <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known by their side effects <unk> mostly because in the time that it takes to get to the stream -- you get <unk> and even for the time you get to your destination, which is where it's more important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily look at the blood store of patients that are attached to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new bacterial cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a life treatment run by an oral charge.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to make the treatment directly at the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you used to be used in <unk> for wounds and surgery of diabetes, can be used for anything else -- including your drug <unk>
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open up or drill extremely small holes open and closed almost almost the cells infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
They ask the best people say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small laser beam on the cellular membrane infected with HIV.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds.
Before you know it, the hole is to shut down immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device of three head.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, then it releases it directly on the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of a lot.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV of the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups of <unk> and <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to confrontation not violent.
I work in the field work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, from the <unk> arrangements of <unk> and 2011, <unk> had been taken between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a social service network, and a military <unk>
Likewise, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza attacks, from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
<unk>
We had a complex machine of communication stations, channels of TV, web channels and social media sites.
And here you have the printed magazine printed in English and published in <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but through <unk> businesses, for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Older groups do also do something else: they create stronger ties to their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't have security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn down by the war, or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price because it's high for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election of 2006 in Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage -- even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they have <unk> gaps by government, and arise out as armed and political groups, participate in nonviolent struggle and governance.
And the more sophisticated and sophisticated organizations are these organizations, we can be able to make it as opposed to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
They put part of a territory, running all of your body -- collect junk system, running the junk system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the weakest the states, and the Middle East today, the <unk> and they fill that gap into non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better what incentives offer to enable the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but we won't give us peace and stability.
To get these goals we need investments to fill that safety gap to fill that safety vacuum of the government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My views on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the tag of <unk> would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I was really excited about as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The bad <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young woman, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as if that's a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated in the world and anger, in particular, seems to be a perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant.
I was struck by a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which begs too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud to be.
To me, certain claims are women equal to men.
They ask the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it in an easy way, and accessible the contraceptives and the <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls, or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, we have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition and skills and much more.
We need to have to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the work, I hear rap music <unk>
Even though the letter degrades women and strikes me in the classic <unk> <unk> by Yin yang -- it's amazing.
Do you actually show your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get rid of the <unk>
So think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely correlated with my musical mistake.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  -- all the things that I don't want to do, but they will also kill insects, the trash collection -- the <unk> <unk> and nest <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and good things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> fantasies of the fairy fairy fairy fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not a <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I hate that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they were born.
So we had this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women in color, the gay workers, gay and <unk> for white, <unk> and <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist box.
You also see the following: As a feminist, a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> feminists <unk>
We hope that it will happen to perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I would be aware of that <unk> before I try to get there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative things and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> fear of what that tag means for not to be able to fulfill a little bit of realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
The last few years is a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music 2014, <unk> in 2014, <unk> in front of the word <unk> three meters tall.
It was a <unk> show looking at this star of the pop star openly and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of it.
<unk> the time, cultural critics begin endless debates if they were <unk> it was or not precisely feminist.
And you know, your feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
We tend to perfection <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much, we need so much.
We go through a lot beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to <unk> to the action and to be a little more <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I am creating a demand for artists that would be happier providing a bacterial supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they protect the change affecting their gain.
It certainly is hard.
Why does the music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions come to justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, gender equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> of three and four years.
They are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
And they are telling them for strong creatures that they are.
I think of them all of a sudden, the best choice is going to be able to be a lot easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
Can we change the channel when a TV program tries to be sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio station when we heard songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when films don't treat women as well as objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish a magazine in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we will be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also encourage it to be including even more of us as we have to engage the barriers to the decision making.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these successes.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the people in the power of <unk> and <unk> and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting change and significant change.
We can also assert with our feminism, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist to be a <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, about everything, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it the incident to address what happened.
A few guys were excited when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that could matter.
But --  I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the thoughtless reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had <unk> to have been to <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
And the virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily infectious diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this for more than half of a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be even <unk> of autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and the vaccines <unk> ages and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists who are the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it to create a whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence continued to only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the '90s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> facilities like <unk> <unk> refer to routinely refer to autism as an epidemic, as if it could be a little kid in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic -- and a better <unk> <unk> to explain these genetic figures.
But that kind of language <unk> a lot of the fear of a young mother who searches on the face of his son of two years, the visual contact of you.
If the criteria of the diagnostic had to be understood why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to find the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is that what happened is about the slow progress and slow progress of the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what the autism is about, and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism than had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds <unk> to people around it, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by waving the hands in their faces, but they were convicted of panic for <unk> as when it doesn't stand their favorite toy in their usual way without knowing them.
On the base of the patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the leading authority of the world on the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of the syndrome as well as <unk> references from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for diagnosing autism were very <unk>
For example, we will be able to give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that the epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine of 10 children by the other doctors to her doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold and <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept carefully on a refrigerator that didn't <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of her young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in the clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite seals, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive cognitive psychologist, I thought that the theory of <unk> mothers was quite stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic child named <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl, and no special education, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To advocate for the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They did a study of prevalence prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse and diverse and diverse in the reality of it.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
In another way, these children didn't fit in bright squares and <unk> as he said, <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model, would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody realize this before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in <unk> the year next to the article of <unk> and then he was later <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was no even one translation of the English -- but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary <unk>
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids followed their games by the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the fathers of causing autism that described it as a <unk> disabled disability, that required <unk> and <unk> spaces during the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, <unk> called them their little teachers, and he took to help in the development of education that were especially suited to them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuous continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were commons and autistic traits were common and have always been able to see aspects of this continuum in architectural culture as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that he was wrong was wrong that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> -- the limited model of <unk> by a broad form of Asperger <unk>
These changes not fell in a broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith were working with it to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> just a little circle, <unk> for experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and fathers knew what the autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics began to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were actually hoping that it was, making the people with autism and their families to have the support and services that are <unk>
And so Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in diagnosis. A simple, powerful, <unk> credible story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention of prevention that one of every 68 children are in the spectrum is right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new breakthroughs -- <unk> <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit for details.
Indeed, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As it comes to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
